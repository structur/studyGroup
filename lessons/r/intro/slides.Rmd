## Learning goals/expectations

- How to interact with R in RStudio
- How to import/export your data
- How to view the structure of your data
- How to wrangle data into analyzable format
- How to write reproducible reports (maybe)

## 4-5 main concepts:

- **Getting the data**: read.table, write.table
- **View the data**: str, summary, names, class
- **Working the data (dplyr):** (tbl\_df), select, filter, mutate,
  summarise, arrange, rename, group\_by, `%>%` pipe
- **(Re)Organize the data (tidyr):** gather, spread
- (Depending on time) **Generate a reproducible document (knitr/rmarkdown):** YAML, code
  chunks, inline code, kable (pander too), render (Knit HTML button)

## Generate these slides using: ##

```{r render, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render('slides.Rmd')
```
