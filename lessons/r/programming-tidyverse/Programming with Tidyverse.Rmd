The goal of this workshop is to learn how to write functions which include Tidyverse packages.

Functions are a way to keep a useful workflow that you use a lot separate so that you can change variables and not accidentally miss one. In this example, the function is a simple addition. Yours can be a subtraction and you can also choose whichever numbers you'd like
```{r}
littleAddition <- function(number1,number2){
  finalNumber=number1+number2
  return(finalNumber)
}

littleAddition(1,2)
```

It's important for this workshop that you have the most recent version of tidyverse since until recently, programming in Tidyverse worked differently.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

Tidyverse is a useful and easy way to manipulate and plot data in R. The normal workflow is import -> tidy -> transform -> visualize -> model and tidyverse has the tools to do all of that. Using the diamonds dataset, we'll go through a basic version of this workflow.

```{r}
#IMPORT#
diamonds <- diamonds
glimpse(diamonds)

```

As you can see, the diamonds dataset has both quantitative and qualitative data. Based on what you saw in glimpse, pick a color of diamond that you're interested in learning more about. I've chosen 'E'. Also for both group_by and colour in the ggplot call, choose between "cut", "clarity", "depth" or "table". I've chosen "cut".

```{r}
#BASIC WORKFLOW#
normalizedDiamonds <- diamonds%>%
    filter(color=="E")%>%
    group_by(cut)%>%
    mutate(normalizedPrice=(price-mean(price))/sd(price))

ggplot(normalizedDiamonds,
       aes(x=carat,y=normalizedPrice,colour=cut))+
    geom_point()
```

But what if you wanted to make a series of graphs using this same simple workflow many times over? What if you wanted to easily switch between these options? The best option would be to make a function which contained your simple workflow.

```{r}
#TIDYING IN A FUNCTION, ATTEMPT 1#
diamondsFunction <- function(diamondColor, diamondVar1, diamondVar2){
  normalizedDiamonds <- diamonds%>%
    filter(color==diamondColor)%>%
    group_by(diamondVar1)%>%
    mutate(normalizedPrice=(price-mean(price))/sd(price))

  diamondPlot <- ggplot(normalizedDiamonds,
                        aes(x=carat,y=normalizedPrice,colour=diamondVar2))+
    geom_point()
print(diamondPlot)
return(normalizedDiamonds)
}

```

Now repeat the variables you picked before when calling the function.
```{r}
#TIDYING IN A FUNCTION, ATTEMPT 1, RESULTS#
diamondsFunction("E",cut,cut)
```
An error will pull up saying that 'diamondVar1' is not found in your group_by. That's because tidyverse scarifices ease of normal workflow for an extra step in programming contexts. What we need to do is *embrace* the variable for diamondVar1 as well as diamondVar2 in the function. The diamondColor variable is fine because in the context of filter, it's part of an expression which produces a logical value, not a variable (the variable is "color" itself).
```{r}
#TIDYING IN A FUNCTION, ATTEMPT 2#
diamondsFunction <- function(diamondColor, diamondVar1,diamondVar2){
  normalizedDiamonds <- diamonds%>%
    filter(color==diamondColor)%>%
    group_by({{diamondVar1}})%>%
    mutate(normalizedPrice=(price-mean(price))/sd(price))

  diamondPlot <- ggplot(normalizedDiamonds,
                        aes(x=carat,y=normalizedPrice,colour={{diamondVar2}}))+
    geom_point()
print(diamondPlot)
return(normalizedDiamonds)
}

diamondsFunction("E",cut,cut)
```
Now you should have a working function! If you want to allow for the possibility of several varaibles to be used, as is the case with diamondsVar1, instead of embracing we'll use "all_of".

```{r}
#TIDYING IN A FUNCTION, ATTEMPT 3#
diamondsFunction <- function(diamondColor, diamondVar1,diamondVar2){
  normalizedDiamonds <- diamonds%>%
    filter(color==diamondColor)%>%
    group_by(all_of(diamondVar1))%>%
    mutate(normalizedPrice=(price-mean(price))/sd(price))

  diamondPlot <- ggplot(normalizedDiamonds,
                        aes(x=carat,y=normalizedPrice,colour={{diamondVar2}}))+
    geom_point()
print(diamondPlot)
return(normalizedDiamonds)
}
vars <- c("cut","clarity")
diamondsFunction("E",vars,cut)
```
You'll have gotten an error. The problem is that group_by is an action verb and not a selection verb so it needs a bit of help understanding inputs like all_of. Use group_by_at instead to fix the problem.
```{r}
#TIDYING IN A FUNCTION, ATTEMPT 4#
diamondsFunction <- function(diamondColor, diamondVar1,diamondVar2){
  normalizedDiamonds <- diamonds%>%
    filter(color==diamondColor)%>%
    group_by_at(all_of(diamondVar1))%>%
    mutate(normalizedPrice=(price-mean(price))/sd(price))

  diamondPlot <- ggplot(normalizedDiamonds,
                        aes(x=carat,y=normalizedPrice,colour={{diamondVar2}}))+
    geom_point()
print(diamondPlot)
return(normalizedDiamonds)
}
vars <- c("cut","clarity")
diamondsFunction("E",vars,cut)
```
