# Learning expectations

This won't even touch the surface of git... But! Hopefully, you:

- Recognize the power of using version control
- Know the basic tools to get started using git
- Where to go for help

But! No expectation to actually start using it :)

# What is Git?
![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

# Getting started with Git and GitHub

Create an account on GitHub

* You set your username, email and password here

## Windows/MacOS
https://desktop.github.com/

* Make sure you install posh-git along with GitHub

## Linux

* Download and install Git for Ubuntu/Debian/Mint Linux
`sudo apt-get install git`

* Download and install Git for Fedora Linux
`sudo dnf install git`

# Configuring your setup:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@some.domain"
```

Optional Configurations
```bash
git config --global color.ui "auto" 
```

Setup Editor for Text Files

```bash
git config --global core.editor "your_editor"
git config --list # To confirm
```

# Creating a Repo on Github
The cloud (GitHub) serves as an online repo where files are accessible 24x7

* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/)

* Create a new repo by pressing the `New Repository` button

* Let us keep the name short and self explanatory and call it 'git-training' 

* We will call this the `remote` repo from here on

# Creating a Git Repo
* change directory (move to another folder) using 
```bash 
cd
```
* to move back one folder use
```bash 
cd ..
```
* to make a new directory
```bash
mkdir
```

# Let us create a `local` Repo
```bash
cd ~/Documents
# for windows users with full path
cd C:/Users/user_name/Documents
# create a new folder 
# use the same name as your remote repo on GitHub
mkdir git-training
# move to the new folder
cd git-training
```
## Convert folder to **git** repo
```bash
git init
```
## check your folder to find git configuration files/folders
This folder is now a git repo (short for repository)

# Using GitHub with Git
If you have GitHub (on Windows/MacOS), you can add the repository you cloned/created to it and visualize the changes

Remember, you installed this earlier?

# Configuring your repo for use with GitHub on the cloud
In order to use this local repo with the one you created earlier we need to set the remote configuration
```bash
git remote -v
```
will tell you what is the remote corresponding to your local repo

If it is empty, you can setup a remote using 
```bash
git remote add remote_name remote_url
```

Before you do this, you need to have an account on GitHub and a repo on it

# Configuring your repo for use with GitHub on the cloud
* Copy the repo url from the repo creation page and use it in
```bash
git remote add origin 
https://github.com/UofTCoders/git-training.git
```

* Check your remote configuration again
```bash
git remote -v
```

# Adding new files to a repo
* create a text file with
    + your name
    + program
    + research area
* save the file as `my_cred` in the git repo you just created

# Visualize changes to files
You can see the changes you made to this file in GitHub
\begin{block}
{New files} on GitHub can be seen with a \textcolor{green}{green '+'} to their right 
\end{block}

This indicates the file is new and is `untracked` by git

\begin{block}
{Old modified files} can be seen with a \textcolor{gray}{gray circle} to their right
\end{block}

This indicates the file is already `tracked` and there are `uncommitted` changes
```bash
git status
``` 
can give information on `tracked`, `untracked` and `indexed` files

# Adding Files to git index
* add the file to the git index
```bash
git add my_cred.txt
```
* check file status again 
```bash
git status
```
Notice the file has changed from \textcolor{red}{red} to \textcolor{green}{green}

* let us `commit` this change to repo history 
```bash
git commit -m "initial commit with my info"
```
* Now your file is `tracked` by git

# `push` to your new repo on GitHub
You can move all your **committed** changes to the remote repo
```bash
git push origin
```
Since this is the first time we are doing this, we need to 
establish a link between your local repo and remote repo. 

you can do this using
```bash
git push -u origin master
```
Make sure your `remote` is set before you do this

# Cloning an Existing `git` repo
We can copy or clone existing repositories from GitHub using
```bash
git clone remote_repo_url
```
Let us do this for the [sandbox repo](https://github.com/UofTCoders/sandbox-2017.git) I have created

Select the green `Clone or Download` button and select ` copy to clipboard`

In your shell/bash move to a directory of your choice and clone the repo
```bash
cd ~/Documents
# if you are using git posh (in powershell) 
# use the right click to paste the copied url
git clone 
https://github.com/UofTCoders/sandbox-2017.git
```

# Modify a existing file and commit changes
Go to the directory containing the example file
```bash
cd sandbox-2017
# see all files in the directory
ls
```
Open file `example_file.md` in any text editor

To open files in bash/shell
```bash
editor_name file_name
notepad example_file.md
```
add a new line to this file starting with an asterisk(*)

save file and close

# Add changes to index and commit changes to repo
We will use the previously used commands to `add` and `commit` files
```bash
git add example_file.md
git commit -m "add one new line to file"
```

# Visualize changes to file
You can use
```bash
git diff example_file.md
```
in the command line

Note the file has to be `tracked` and 
the changes have to be `committed` to use `git diff`

You can also visualize all commits to the repo using
```bash
git log
```

commit information can be obtained in a cleaner format using 
```bash
git log --online
```

# `push` commits to the remote repo
Let us first check the `remote` configuration
```bash
git remote -v
```
Notice that the remote is already set

```bash
git push origin
```
will push your `local` changes to the `remote` repo

# Discarding changes in your repo
Discard \textcolor{red}{unstaged} \textcolor{gray}{Tracked} files using
```bash
git checkout .
```
Discard \textcolor{red}{unstaged} unTracked files using
```bash
git clean -f
```
Use this command with caution:

Discard \textcolor{green}{staged} and \textcolor{red}{unstaged} Tracked changes using
```bash
git reset --hard
```
