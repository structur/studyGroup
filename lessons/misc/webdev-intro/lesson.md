# Preface

This lesson is an introduction to making web applications. A little HTML and CSS are covered as base-level knowledge, but the focus should be on the Document Object Model (DOM) and JavaScript.

The actual lesson contents are in [`contents.md`](../contents/index.html). 
Part of the lesson is a demo app that reads `contents.md` and makes a slide presentation (found [*here*](../slides.html)). This app is left in an intentionally poorly designed state to demonstrate concepts like scoping. Comments are littered throughout for a novice reader.

To view the demo, either run a web server in this directory (e.g. `python -m http.server`) or view the latest version at <https://jladan.github.io/webdev-basics>.
