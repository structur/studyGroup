## What is open data?
[“Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.”](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/)

More specifically, from the open data handbook and [opendefinition.org](http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/):
- Availability and Access: the data must be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably by downloading over the internet. The data must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form.
- Re-use and Redistribution: the data must be provided under terms that permit re-use and redistribution including the intermixing with other datasets.
- Universal Participation: everyone must be able to use, re-use and redistribute - there should be no discrimination against fields of endeavour or against persons or groups. For example, ‘non-commercial’ restrictions that would prevent ‘commercial’ use, or restrictions of use for certain purposes (e.g. only in education), are not allowed.

## [Why open data?](https://mozillascience.github.io/open-data-primers/1.1-what-and-why.html)
- Maintain accountability:
When data is open, the results or findings of that data can be more easily verified, increasing public trust in research institutions and governments.
- Speed discovery:
When data is open, researchers working in parallel on similar problems don’t need to duplicate work and can use each other’s data to advance knowledge across their research area.
- Encourage collaboration across disciplines:
When data is open, researchers can more easily find those outside their subject area doing related or relevant work; these connections and collaborations may lead to new ways of approaching and solving problems.
- Solve a broader range of problems:
When data is open, new users-- from academic researchers to citizen scientists to artists-- may use it to answer questions, solve problems, or create public understanding in ways that the original data collector may never have imagined.
- Encourage public engagement with research:
When data is open and the findings are shared in a clear and accessible way, it increases public understanding, creates opportunities for public participation, and bolsters public support of research initiatives.
- Ensure that data is preserved:
When data is open and widely shared, the responsibility for the long-term archiving and preservation of that data is distributed across broader group of interested users.

Grant agencies care about open data:
- Tri-agency (i.e. NSERC, CIHR, SSHRC) policy on data: [Data Management Policy](http://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_83F7624E.html?OpenDocument) and [Open Access Policy](http://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_F6765465.html?OpenDocument)

## Challenges to open data
- reference [handout](https://github.com/mozillascience/open-data-training/blob/master/Materials/Handouts/ODChallengesQI.md) from Mozilla open data training
- ["Differential privacy"](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/apples-differential-privacy-collecting-data/) as a way to anonymize sensitive data. [More technical/not for dummies](https://robertovitillo.com/2016/07/29/differential-privacy-for-dummies/)


## How to open your data
- Metadata
- Create a DATA_README
- Use the [data reuse checklist](https://mozillascience.github.io/checklist/)
