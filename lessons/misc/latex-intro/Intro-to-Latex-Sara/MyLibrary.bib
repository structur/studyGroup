  abstract = {Epilepsy, affecting about 1\% of the population, comprises a group of neurological disorders characterized by the periodic occurrence of seizures, which disrupt normal brain function. Despite treatment with currently available antiepileptic drugs targeting neuronal functions, one third of patients with epilepsy are pharmacoresistant. In this condition, surgical resection of the brain area generating seizures remains the only alternative treatment. Studying human epileptic tissues has contributed to understand new epileptogenic mechanisms during the last 10 years. Indeed, these tissues generate spontaneous interictal epileptic discharges as well as pharmacologically-induced ictal events which can be recorded with classical electrophysiology techniques. Remarkably, multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), which are microfabricated devices embedding an array of spatially arranged microelectrodes, provide the unique opportunity to simultaneously stimulate and record field potentials, as well as action potentials of multiple neurons from different areas of the tissue. Thus MEAs recordings offer an excellent approach to study the spatio-temporal patterns of spontaneous interictal and evoked seizure-like events and the mechanisms underlying seizure onset and propagation. Here we describe how to prepare human cortical slices from surgically resected tissue and to record with MEAs interictal and ictal-like events ex vivo.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) networks are often used to model neural network activity. The spike trains they produce, however, cannot be directly compared to the local field potentials (LFPs) that are measured by low-pass filtering the potential recorded from extracellular electrodes. This is because LFPs are generated by neurons with spatial extensions, while LIF networks typically consist of point neurons. In order to still be able to approximately predict LFPs from LIF network simulations, we here explore simple proxies for computing LFPs based on standard output from LIF network simulations. Predictions from the various LFP proxies were compared with ``ground-truth'' LFPs computed by means of well-established volume conduction theory where synaptic currents corresponding to the LIF network simulation were injected into populations of multi-compartmental neurons with realistic morphologies. We found that a simple weighted sum of the LIF synaptic currents with a single universally applicable set of weights excellently capture the time course of the LFP signal when the LFP predominantly is generated by a single population of pyramidal cells. Our study therefore provides a simple formula by which the LFP signal can be estimated directly from the LIF network activity, providing a missing quantitative link between simple neural models and LFP measures in vivo.},

For these functions, the gamma rhythm frequency must be consistent across neural assemblies encoding the features of a stimulus. Here we test the dependence of gamma frequency on stimulus contrast in V1 cortex of awake behaving macaques and show that gamma frequency increases monotonically with contrast. Changes in stimulus contrast over time leads to a reliable gamma frequency modulation on a fast timescale. Further, large stimuli whose contrast varies across space generate gamma rhythms at significantly different frequencies in simultaneously recorded neuronal assemblies separated by as little as 400 $\mu$m, making the gamma rhythm a poor candidate for binding or communication, at least in V1. Instead, our results suggest that the gamma rhythm arises from local interactions between excitation and inhibition.},

We simulated the electric potential generated from axon-hillock region contributed significantly to the single neuron extracellular field. Models of cerebellar granule neuron and L5 pyramidal neuron were used to study single neuron extracellular field potentials. Attenuation properties of the extracellular medium were studied via the granule cell model. A computational model of a rat Crus-IIa cerebellar granular layer, built with detailed anatomical and physiological properties allowed reconstructing population LFP. As with single neurons, the same technique was able to reconstruct the T and C waves of evoked postsynaptic in vivo LFP trace. In addition to role of attenuation on the width of signals, plasticity was simulated via modifications of intrinsic properties of underlying neurons and population LFP validated experimental data correlating network function to underlying single neuron activity.},

  abstract = {Spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) resulting from extracellular current flows provide a substrate for neural information processing. Understanding the neural code from simultaneous spike-field recordings and subsequent decoding of information processing events will have widespread applications. One way to demonstrate an understanding of the neural code, with particular advantages for the development of applications, is to formulate a parametric statistical model of neural activity and its covariates. Here, we propose a set of parametric spike-field models (unified models) that can be used with existing decoding algorithms to reveal the timing of task or stimulus specific processing. Our proposed unified modeling framework captures the effects of two important features of information processing: time-varying stimulus-driven inputs and ongoing background activity that occurs even in the absence of environmental inputs. We have applied this framework for decoding neural latencies in simulated and experimentally recorded spike-field sessions obtained from the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of awake, behaving monkeys performing cued look-and-reach movements to spatial targets. Using both simulated and experimental data, we find that estimates of trial-by-trial parameters are not significantly affected by the presence of ongoing background activity. However, including background activity in the unified model improves goodness of fit for predicting individual spiking events. Uncovering the relationship between the model parameters and the timing of movements offers new ways to test hypotheses about the relationship between neural activity and behavior. We obtained significant spike-field onset time correlations from single trials using a previously published data set where significantly strong correlation was only obtained through trial averaging. We also found that unified models extracted a stronger relationship between neural response latency and trial-by-trial behavioral performance than existing models of neural information processing. Our results highlight the utility of the unified modeling framework for characterizing spike-LFP recordings obtained during behavioral performance.},

The origin of these signals is yet unknown. Using computational modeling, we show that a cortical network model receiving thalamic input generates high-gamma responses comparable to those observed in local field potential recorded in monkey somatosensory cortex during vibrotactile stimulation. These high-gamma oscillations appear to be mediated mostly by an excited population of inhibitory fast-spiking interneurons firing at high-gamma frequencies and pacing excitatory regular-spiking pyramidal cells, which fire at lower rates but in phase with the population rhythm. The physiological correlates of high-gamma activity, in this model of local cortical circuits, appear to be similar to those proposed for hippocampal ripples generated by subsets of interneurons that regulate the discharge of principal cells.},

This is an effort to explore the parameter space of stimulation variables to uncover promising avenues of research for this therapeutic modality. The model consists of an approximately 800 $\mu$m \texttimes{} 800 $\mu$m region of simulated cortex, and includes seven neuron classes organized by cortical layer, inhibitory or excitatory properties, and electrophysiological characteristics. The cell dynamics are governed by a modified version of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations in single compartment format. Axonal connections are patterned after histological data and published models of local cortical wiring. Stimulation induced action potentials take place at the axon initial segments, according to threshold requirements on the applied electric field distribution. Stimulation induced action potentials in horizontal axonal branches are also separately simulated. The calculations are performed on a 16 node distributed 32-bit processor system. Clear differences in seizure evolution are presented for stimulated versus the undisturbed rhythmic activity. Data is provided for frequency dependent stimulation effects demonstrating a plateau effect of stimulation efficacy as the applied frequency is increased from 60 Hz to 200 Hz. Timing of the stimulation with respect to the underlying rhythmic activity demonstrates a phase dependent sensitivity. Electrode height and position effects are also presented. Using a dipole stimulation electrode arrangement, clear orientation effects of the dipole with respect to the model connectivity is also demonstrated. A sensitivity analysis of these results as a function of the stimulation threshold is also provided.},

  abstract = {Neuronal spike sorting algorithms are designed to retrieve neuronal network activity on a single-cell level from extracellular multiunit recordings with Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs). In typical analysis of MEA data, one spike sorting algorithm is applied indiscriminately to all electrode signals. However, this approach neglects the dependency of algorithms' performances on the neuronal signals properties at each channel, which require data-centric methods. Moreover, sorting is commonly performed off-line, which is time and memory consuming and prevents researchers from having an immediate glance at ongoing experiments. The aim of this work is to provide a versatile framework to support the evaluation and comparison of different spike classification algorithms suitable for both off-line and on-line analysis. We incorporated different spike sorting ``building blocks'' into a Matlab-based software, including 4 feature extraction methods, 3 feature clustering methods, and 1 template matching classifier. The framework was validated by applying different algorithms on simulated and real signals from neuronal cultures coupled to MEAs. Moreover, the system has been proven effective in running on-line analysis on a standard desktop computer, after the selection of the most suitable sorting methods. This work provides a useful and versatile instrument for a supported comparison of different options for spike sorting towards more accurate off-line and on-line MEA data analysis.},

  abstract = {Several multi-electrode array devices integrating planar metal electrodes were designed in the past 30 years for extracellular stimulation and recording from cultured neuronal cells and organotypic brain slices. However, these devices are not well suited for recordings from acute brain slice preparations due to a dead cell layer at the tissue slice border that appears during the cutting procedure. To overcome this problem, we propose the use of protruding 3D electrodes, i.e. tip-shaped electrodes, allowing tissue penetration in order to get closer to living neurons in the tissue slice. In this paper, we describe the design and fabrication of planar and 3D protruding multi-electrode arrays. The electrical differences between planar and 3D protruding electrode configuration were simulated and verified experimentally. Finally, a comparison between the planar and 3D protruding electrode configuration was realized by stimulation and recording from acute rat hippocampus slices. The results show that larger signal amplitudes in the millivolt range can be obtained with the 3D electrode devices. Spikes corresponding to single cell activity could be monitored in the hippocampus CA3 and CA1 region using 3D electrodes.},

  abstract = {Neuronal microcircuits are formed of a myriad of spatially and functionally specific cell classes. Despite the importance of the spatial component in the characterisation of neural circuits, it has not received the attention it deserves. While multi-electrodes are widely used in the study of microcircuits, the spatial information available from them remains largely unexploited for analysis beyond spike sorting. Here we show how the spatial pattern of the extracellular signal is determined by both the electrophysiology and morphology of neurons. Starting from known current source models for the generation of the extracellular potential, we use the spatial pattern observed across a multi-electrode array to localise and classify neurons into putative morphological classes. We evaluated the localisation and classification models with low fitting errors in simulated data. When applying them to recorded data we found correspondence between localisation statistics and expected recording radius and found evidence to support the separation into putative morphological classes. While existing localisation methods do not hold for the recording distances expected on multi-electrode recordings (under 60 $\mu$m), classification methods have been limited to the temporal component by either characterising spike shape or firing patterns. We show here how the information available from extracellular recordings can be used to localise and classify neurons based on the spatial pattern seen by multi-electrode arrays. Together they can improve current characterisation and classification of neurons based on complementary criteria such us firing pattern and functional characterisation.},

However, despite its relative simplicity, this recording technique is not widely used in academic or pharmaceutical research laboratories. We illustrate here that MEA provide multiple possibilities to investigate some network physiological properties as well as to evaluate the pharmacological effects of compounds. We first document that MEA allow to trigger and to record conventional FP which are inhibited by the block of action potential propagation (with 500 nM TTX). FP recorded with MEA are sensitive to ionic substitutions, to ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (CNQX or NBQX) and to energetic failure. Second, we illustrate that different "classical" protocols (paired-pulse, LTP, chemical LTD), revealing synaptic plasticity mechanisms, could be performed. Third, we document that MEA allow spatial and temporal discriminations for the effects of known pharmacological compounds such as competitive antagonist (gabazine, bicuculline) and allosteric modulators (steroids) of GABA(A) receptors. In conclusion, we illustrate that MEA recordings of adult rat hippocampal slices constitute a powerful and sensitive system to evaluate the effect of molecules on basic synaptic propagation/transmission and on synaptic plasticity processes.},

For in vitro studies pursuing these goals, substrate integrated, planar microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have been developed to monitor spikes and local field potentials. Here we report for the first time recordings of single-unit spike activity with MEAs in acute slice preparations of the rat cerebellum. We compare these recordings to results of conventional techniques, and discuss the recording conditions in view of the equivalent circuits commonly used. Simultaneous recordings with tungsten microelectrodes and MEAs verified that recording characteristics and signal-to-noise ratios of MEA electrodes were comparable to those of conventional extracellular electrodes. Spike shapes were identical on both electrodes. We found no detectable overlap between spike signals recorded at neighboring MEA electrodes (200 microm spacing). Neuronal spike activity was detected with MEA electrodes at distances of up to 100 microm from the site of spike generation. We conclude that extracellular recording of independent single-unit spike activity with MEAs is indeed suitable to monitor network activity in acute slices, making MEAs an exceptionally useful tool for the assessment of fast network dynamics in acute slices.},

Existing tools for electrically interfacing with organotypic slices do not address necrosis that inevitably occurs within thick slices with limited diffusion of nutrients and gas, and limited removal of waste. We developed an integrated device that enables long-term maintenance of thick, functionally active, brain tissue models using interstitial perfusion and distributed recordings from thick sections of explanted tissue on a perforated multi-electrode array. This novel device allows for automated culturing, in situ imaging, and extracellular multi-electrode interfacing with brain slices, 3 D cell cultures, and potentially other tissue culture models. The device is economical, easy to assemble, and integrable with standard electrophysiology tools. We found that convective perfusion through the culture thickness provided a functional benefit to the preparations as firing rates were generally higher in perfused cultures compared to their respective unperfused controls. This work is a step towards the development of integrated tools for days-long experiments with more consistent, healthier, thicker, and functionally more active tissue cultures with built-in distributed electrophysiological recording and stimulation functionality. The results may be useful for the study of normal processes, pathological conditions, and drug screening strategies currently hindered by the limitations of acute (a few hours long) brain slice preparations.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jneumeth.2016.04.019},
  abstract = {Background
Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) occurs when non-identical frequency components entrain one another. A ubiquitous example from neuroscience is low frequency phase to high frequency amplitude coupling in electrophysiological signals. Seminal work by Canolty revealed CFC in human ECoG data. Established methods band-pass the data into component frequencies then convert the band-passed signals into the analytic representation, from which we infer the instantaneous amplitude and phase of each component. Though powerful, such methods resolve signals with respect to time and frequency without addressing the multiresolution problem.
New method
We build upon the ground-breaking work of Canolty and others and derive a wavelet-based CFC detection algorithm that efficiently searches a range of frequencies using a sequence of filters with optimal trade-off between time and frequency resolution. We validate our method using simulated data and analyze CFC within and between the primary motor cortex and dorsal striatum of rats under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia.
Results
Our method detects the correct CFC in simulated data and reveals CFC between frequency bands that were previously shown to participate in corticostriatal effective connectivity.
Comparison with existing methods
Other CFC detection methods address the need to increase bandwidth when analyzing high frequency components but none to date permit rigorous bandwidth selection with no a priori knowledge of underlying CFC. Our method is thus particularly useful for exploratory studies.
Conclusions
The method developed here permits rigorous and efficient exploration of a hypothesis space and is particularly useful when the frequencies participating in CFC are unknown.},

There has been particular interest in the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, since recent evidence suggests a functional role for this type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Phase-amplitude coupling has been reported in continuous electrophysiological signals obtained from the brain at both local and macroscopic levels. In the present work, we present a new measure for assessing phase-amplitude CFC. This measure is defined as an adaptation of the Kullback\textendash{}Leibler distance\textemdash{}a function that is used to infer the distance between two distributions\textemdash{}and calculates how much an empirical amplitude distribution-like function over phase bins deviates from the uniform distribution. We show that a CFC measure defined this way is well suited for assessing the intensity of phase-amplitude coupling. We also review seven other CFC measures; we show that, by some performance benchmarks, our measure is especially attractive for this task. We also discuss some technical aspects related to the measure, such as the length of the epochs used for these analyses and the utility of surrogate control analyses. Finally, we apply the measure and a related CFC tool to actual hippocampal recordings obtained from freely moving rats and show, for the first time, that the CA3 and CA1 regions present different CFC characteristics.},

We identified that successful\textemdash{}but not failed\textemdash{}selection of relevant information followed the coupling of slow and fast frequencies at narrow oscillation phases, with interareal anatomical specificity, and based on a reset mechanism for the slow oscillation. These findings suggest a specific functional and mechanistic solution to the fundamental coordination problem in primate brains., Anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC) are believed to coordinate activity to flexibly prioritize the processing of goal-relevant over irrelevant information. This between-area coordination may be realized by common low-frequency excitability changes synchronizing segregated high-frequency activations. We tested this coordination hypothesis by recording in macaque ACC/PFC during the covert utilization of attention cues. We found robust increases of 5\textendash{}10 Hz (theta) to 35\textendash{}55 Hz (gamma) phase\textendash{}amplitude correlation between ACC and PFC during successful attention shifts but not before errors. Cortical sites providing theta phases (i) showed a prominent cue-induced phase reset, (ii) were more likely in ACC than PFC, and (iii) hosted neurons with burst firing events that synchronized to distant gamma activity. These findings suggest that interareal theta\textendash{}gamma correlations could follow mechanistically from a cue-triggered reactivation of rule memory that synchronizes theta across ACC/PFC.},

Clustering is one of the most popular data mining methods, not only due to its exploratory power, but also as a preprocessing step or subroutine for other techniques. In this paper, we present k-Shape, a novel algorithm for time-series clustering. k-Shape relies on a scalable iterative refinement procedure, which creates homogeneous and well-separated clusters. As its distance measure, k-Shape uses a normalized version of the cross-correlation measure in order to consider the shapes of time series while comparing them. Based on the properties of that distance measure, we develop a method to compute cluster centroids, which are used in every iteration to update the assignment of time series to clusters. To demonstrate the robustness of k-Shape, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our approach against partitional, hierarchical, and spectral clustering methods, with combinations of the most competitive distance measures. k-Shape outperforms all scalable approaches in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, k-Shape also outperforms all non-scalable (and hence impractical) combinations, with one exception that achieves similar accuracy results. However, unlike k-Shape, this combination requires tuning of its distance measure and is two orders of magnitude slower than k-Shape. Overall, k-Shape emerges as a domain-independent, highly accurate, and highly efficient clustering approach for time series with broad applications.},

In such cases, the belonging of an object to a class is a matter of degree, as is the question of whether or not a group of objects form a cluster. A pioneering application of the theory of fuzzy sets to cluster analysis was made in 1969 by Ruspini. It was not until 1973, however, when the appearance of the work by Dunn and Bezdek on the Fuzzy ISODATA (or fuzzy c-means) algorithms became a landmark in the theory of cluster analysis, that the relevance of the theory of fuzzy sets to cluster analysis and pattern recognition became clearly established. Since then, the theory of fuzzy clustering has developed rapidly and fruitfully, with the author of the present monograph contributing a major share of what we know today. In their seminal work, Bezdek and Dunn have introduced the basic idea of determining the fuzzy clusters by minimizing an appropriately defined functional, and have derived iterative algorithms for computing the membership functions for the clusters in question. The important issue of convergence of such algorithms has become much better understood as a result of recent work which is described in the monograph.},

The vertebrate retina has these features in common with invertebrate circuits, suggesting that they are general across animals.

The cellular diversity of the brain necessitates a cellular resolution approach towards understanding the functional genomics of the nervous system. We describe here an anatomically comprehensive digital atlas containing the expression patterns of 20,000 genes in the adult mouse brain. Data were generated using automated high-throughput procedures for in situ hybridization and data acquisition, and are publicly accessible online. Newly developed image-based informatics tools allow global genome-scale structural analysis and cross-correlation, as well as identification of regionally enriched genes. Unbiased fine-resolution analysis has identified highly specific cellular markers as well as extensive evidence of cellular heterogeneity not evident in classical neuroanatomical atlases. This highly standardized atlas provides an open, primary data resource for a wide variety of further studies concerning brain organization and function.},

Uncovering the operational principles of these elaborate circuits requires the probing of electrical activity from selected populations of defined neurons. Here we show that genetically encoded voltage-sensitive fluorescent proteins (VSFPs) provide an optical voltage report from targeted neurons in culture, acute brain slices and living mice. By expressing VSFPs in pyramidal cells of mouse somatosensory cortex, we also demonstrate that these probes can report cortical electrical responses to single sensory stimuli in vivo. These protein-based voltage probes will facilitate the analysis of cortical circuits in genetically defined cell populations and are hence a valuable addition to the optogenetic toolbox.

Here we use light-sheet microscopy to record activity, reported through the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5G, from the entire volume of the brain of the larval zebrafish in vivo at 0.8 Hz, capturing more than 80\% of all neurons at single-cell resolution. Demonstrating how this technique can be used to reveal functionally defined circuits across the brain, we identify two populations of neurons with correlated activity patterns. One circuit consists of hindbrain neurons functionally coupled to spinal cord neuropil. The other consists of an anatomically symmetric population in the anterior hindbrain, with activity in the left and right halves oscillating in antiphase, on a timescale of 20 s, and coupled to equally slow oscillations in the inferior olive.

We investigate the influence of scattering on both fluorescence excitation and collection, and identify tissue and instrument parameters that limit the imaging depth in the brain. (i) In brain slices, we measured that the scattering length at $\lambda$=800 nm is a factor 2 higher in juvenile cortical tissue (P14\textendash{}P18) than in adult tissue (P90). (ii) In a detection geometry typical for in vivo imaging, we show that the collected fraction of fluorescence drops at large depths, and that it is proportional to the square of the effective angular acceptance of the detection optics. Matching the angular acceptance of the microscope to that of the objective lens can result in a gain of $\sim$3 in collection efficiency at large depths (\&gt;500 $\mu$m). A low-magnification (20\texttimes), high-numerical aperture objective (0.95) further increases fluorescence collection by a factor of $\sim$10 compared with a standard 60\texttimes\textendash{}63\texttimes{} objective without compromising the resolution. This improvement should allow fluorescence measurements related to neuronal or vascular brain activity at \&gt;100 $\mu$m deeper than with standard objectives.},

However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing adeno-associated viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography to image the EGFP-labelled axons throughout the brain. This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational resource for structural and functional investigations into the neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes in health and disease.

We describe PACT (passive clarity technique), a protocol for passive tissue clearing and immunostaining of intact organs; RIMS (refractive index matching solution), a mounting media for imaging thick tissue; and PARS (perfusion-assisted agent release in situ), a method for whole-body clearing and immunolabeling. We show that in rodents PACT, RIMS, and PARS are compatible with endogenous-fluorescence, immunohistochemistry, RNA single-molecule FISH, long-term storage, and microscopy with cellular and subcellular resolution.

The steps are 1$^\circ$ clearing of the opaque tissue to render it transparent for microscopy, 2$^\circ$ fluorescence labeling of the tissues and 3$^\circ$ 3D imaging. In the past decades, new methodologies were introduced for the clearing steps with their specific advantages and disadvantages. Most clearing techniques have been applied to the central nervous system and other organs that contain relatively low amounts of connective tissue including extracellular matrix. However, tissues that contain large amounts of extracellular matrix such as dermis in skin or gingiva are difficult to clear. The present survey lists methodologies that are available for clearing of tissues for 3D imaging. We report here that the BABB method using a mixture of benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate and iDISCO using dibenzylether (DBE) are the most successful methods for clearing connective tissue-rich gingiva and dermis of skin for 3D histochemistry and imaging of fluorescence using light-sheet microscopy.},

Such techniques are crucial for the analysis of complete neuronal morphology-anatomical and functional-connectivity, and repeated molecular phenotyping. CLARITY is a recently introduced technique that produces structurally intact, yet optically transparent tissue, which may be labeled and imaged without sectioning. However, the utility of this technique depends on several procedural variables during the process in which the light-scattering lipids in a tissue are replaced by a transparent hydrogel matrix. Here, we systematically varied a number of factors (including temperature, hydrogel composition, and polymerization conditions) to provide an optimized, highly replicable CLARITY procedure for clearing mouse brains. We found that for these preparations optimal tissue clearing requires electrophoresis (and cannot be achieved with passive clearing alone) for 5 d with a combination of 37 and 55$^\circ$C temperature. Although this protocol is optimized for brains, we also show that it can be used to clear and analyze a variety of organs. Brain or other tissue prepared using this protocol is suitable for high-throughput imaging with confocal or single-plane illumination microscopy.},

  abstract = {Imaging, electrophysiological, and lesion studies have shown a relationship between the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and the processing of spatial scenes. Our present knowledge of PHC, however, is restricted to the macroscopic properties and dynamics of bulk tissue; the behavior and selectivity of single parahippocampal neurons remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed responses from 630 parahippocampal neurons in 24 neurosurgical patients during visual stimulus presentation. We found a spatially clustered subpopulation of scene-selective units with an associated event-related field potential. These units form a population code that is more distributed for scenes than for other stimulus categories, and less sparse than elsewhere in the medial temporal lobe. Our electrophysiological findings provide insight into how individual units give rise to the population response observed with functional imaging in the parahippocampal place area.},

  abstract = {Cortical networks exhibit 'global oscillations', in which neural spike times are entrained to an underlying oscillatory rhythm, but where individual neurons fire irregularly, on only a fraction of cycles. While the network dynamics underlying global oscillations have been well characterised, their function is debated. Here, we show that such global oscillations are a direct consequence of optimal efficient coding in spiking networks with synaptic delays and noise. To avoid firing unnecessary spikes, neurons need to share information about the network state. Ideally, membrane potentials should be strongly correlated and reflect a 'prediction error' while the spikes themselves are uncorrelated and occur rarely. We show that the most efficient representation is when: (i) spike times are entrained to a global Gamma rhythm (implying a consistent representation of the error); but (ii) few neurons fire on each cycle (implying high efficiency), while (iii) excitation and inhibition are tightly balanced. This suggests that cortical networks exhibiting such dynamics are tuned to achieve a maximally efficient population code., DOI:

  abstract = {Recent findings indicate that the hippocampus supports not only long-term memory encoding but also plays a role in working memory (WM) maintenance of multiple items; however, the neural mechanism underlying multi-item maintenance is still unclear. Theoretical work suggests that multiple items are being maintained by neural assemblies synchronized in the gamma frequency range (25\textendash{}100 Hz) that are locked to consecutive phase ranges of oscillatory activity in the theta frequency range (4\textendash{}8 Hz). Indeed, cross-frequency coupling of the amplitude of high-frequency activity to the phase of slower oscillations has been described both in animals and in humans, but has never been linked to a theoretical model of a cognitive process. Here we used intracranial EEG recordings in human epilepsy patients to test pivotal predictions from theoretical work. First, we show that simultaneous maintenance of multiple items in WM is accompanied by cross-frequency coupling of oscillatory activity in the hippocampus, which is recruited during multi-item WM. Second, maintenance of an increasing number of items is associated with modulation of beta/gamma amplitude with theta band activity of lower frequency, consistent with the idea that longer cycles are required for an increased number of representations by gamma cycles. This effect cannot be explained by a difference in theta or beta/gamma power. Third, we describe how the precision of cross-frequency coupling predicts individual WM performance. These data support the idea that working memory in humans depends on a neural code using phase information.},

To facilitate construction of system models with multiple cell types, we generate a database of point models associated with the Allen Cell Types Database. We construct a series of generalized integrate-and-fire (GLIF) models of increasing complexity aiming to reproduce the spiking behaviors of the recorded neurons. We test the performance of these GLIF models on data from 771 neurons from 14 transgenic lines, with increasing model performance for more complex models. To answer how complex a model needs to be to reproduce the number of electrophysiological cell types, we perform unsupervised clustering on the parameters extracted from these models. The number of clusters is smaller for individual model types, but when combining all GLIF parameters 18 clusters are obtained, while 11 clusters are obtained using 16 electrophysiological features. Therefore, these low dimensional models have the capacity to characterize the diversity of cell types without the need for a priori defined features.},

  abstract = {In Parkinson's disease (PD), striatal dopamine denervation results in a cascade of abnormalities in the single-unit activity of downstream basal ganglia nuclei that include increased firing rate, altered firing patterns, and increased oscillatory activity. However, the effects of these abnormalities on cortical function are poorly understood. Here, in humans undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation surgery, we use the novel technique of subdural electrocorticography in combination with subthalamic nucleus (STN) single-unit recording to study basal ganglia\textendash{}cortex interactions at the millisecond time scale. We show that in patients with PD, STN spiking is synchronized with primary motor cortex (M1) local field potentials in two distinct patterns: first, STN spikes are phase-synchronized with M1 rhythms in the theta, alpha, or beta (4\textendash{}30 Hz) bands. Second, STN spikes are synchronized with M1 gamma activity over a broad spectral range (50\textendash{}200 Hz). The amplitude of STN spike-synchronized gamma activity in M1 is itself rhythmically modulated by the phase of a lower-frequency rhythm (phase-amplitude coupling), such that ``waves'' of phase-synchronized gamma activity precede the occurrence of STN spikes. We show the disease specificity of these phenomena in PD, by comparison with STN-M1 paired recordings performed in a group of patients with a different disorder, primary craniocervical dystonia. Our findings support a model of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop in PD in which gamma activity in primary motor cortex, modulated by the phase of low-frequency rhythms, drives STN unit discharge.},

Physiological studies suggest that short-term memories are stored by patterns of neuronal activity. Here it is shown that activity patterns associated with multiple memories can be stored in a single neural network that exhibits nested oscillations similar to those recorded from the brain. Each memory is stored in a different high-frequency ("40 hertz") subcycle of a low-frequency oscillation. Memory patterns repeat on each low-frequency (5 to 12 hertz) oscillation, a repetition that relies on activity-dependent changes in membrane excitability rather than reverberatory circuits. This work suggests that brain oscillations are a timing mechanism for controlling the serial processing of short-term memories.},

  abstract = {In Parkinson's disease (PD), the oscillatory activity recorded from the basal ganglia shows dopamine-dependent changes. In the ``off'' parkinsonian motor state, there is prominent activity in the beta band (12\textendash{}30 Hz) that is mostly attenuated after dopaminergic therapy (``on'' medication state). The on state is also characterized by activity in the gamma (60\textendash{}80 Hz) and high-frequency (300 Hz) bands that is modulated by movement. We recorded local field potentials from a group of 15 PD patients (three females) treated with bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, using a high sampling rate (2 kHz) and filters suitable to study high-frequency activity (0.3\textendash{}1000 Hz). We observed high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in both the off and on motor states. In the off state, the amplitude of the HFOs was coupled to the phase of the abnormal beta activity. The beta-coupled HFOs showed little or even negative movement-related changes in amplitude. Moreover, the degree of movement-related modulation of the HFOs correlated negatively with the rigidity/bradykinesia scores. In the on motor state, the HFOs were liberated from this beta coupling, and they displayed marked movement-related amplitude modulation. Cross-frequency interactions between the phase of slow activities and the amplitude of fast frequencies have been attributed an important role in information processing in cortical structures. Our findings suggest that nonlinear coupling between frequencies may not only be a physiological mechanism (as shown previously) but also that it may participate in the pathophysiology of parkinsonism.},

Theta\textendash{}gamma comodulation (TGC) was prominent during successful memory retrieval but was weak when memory failed or was unavailable during spatial exploration in sample trials.

In contrast, patterned electrical stimulation of the fimbria-fornix increased TGC in amnestic animals and partially rescued memory performance in the water maze.

  abstract = {The use of chronic intracortical multielectrode arrays has become increasingly prevalent in neurophysiological experiments. However, it is not obvious whether neuronal signals obtained over multiple recording sessions come from the same or different neurons. Here, we develop a criterion to assess single-unit stability by measuring the similarity of 1) average spike waveforms and 2) interspike interval histograms (ISIHs). Neuronal activity was recorded from four Utah arrays implanted in primary motor and premotor cortices in three rhesus macaque monkeys during 10 recording sessions over a 15- to 17-day period. A unit was defined as stable through a given day if the stability criterion was satisfied on all recordings leading up to that day. We found that 57\% of the original units were stable through 7 days, 43\% were stable through 10 days, and 39\% were stable through 15 days. Moreover, stable units were more likely to remain stable in subsequent recording sessions (i.e., 89\% of the neurons that were stable through four sessions remained stable on the fifth). Using both waveform and ISIH data instead of just waveforms improved performance by reducing the number of false positives. We also demonstrate that this method can be used to track neurons across days, even during adaptation to a visuomotor rotation. Identifying a stable subset of neurons should allow the study of long-term learning effects across days and has practical implications for pooling of behavioral data across days and for increasing the effectiveness of brain-machine interfaces.},

In most current experimental settings, we can only record from tens of neurons for a few hours at a time. A major question in systems neuroscience is whether our interpretation of how neurons interact would change if we monitor orders of magnitude more neurons and for substantially more time. In this study, we use realistic networks of model neurons, which allow us to analyze the activity from as many model neurons as we want for as long as we want. For these models, we found that we can identify the salient interactions among neurons and interpret their activity meaningfully within the range of neurons and recording time available in current experiments. Furthermore, we studied how the neural activity from the models reflects how the neurons are connected. These results help to guide the interpretation of analyses using populations of neurons in the context of the larger network to understand brain function.},

  abstract = {Sensory adaptation allows stimulus sensitivity to be dynamically modulated according to stimulus statistics and plays pivotal roles in efficient neural computation. Here, it is hypothesized that in the auditory cortex, phase locking of local field potentials (LFPs) to test tones exhibits an adaptation property, i.e., phase-locking adaptation, which is distinct from the amplitude adaptation of oscillatory components. Series of alternating tone sequences were applied in which the inter-tone interval (ITI) and frequency difference ($\Delta$F) between successive tones were varied. Then, adaptation was characterized by the temporal evolution of the band-specific amplitude and phase locking evoked by the test tones. Differences as well as similarities were revealed between amplitude and phase-locking adaptations. First, both amplitude and phase-locking adaptations were enhanced by short ITIs and small $\Delta$Fs. Second, the amplitude adaptation was more effective in a higher frequency band, while the phase-locking adaptation was more effective in a lower frequency band. Third, as with the adaptation of multiunit activities (MUAs), the amplitude adaptation occurred mainly within a second, while the phase-locking showed multi-second adaptation specifically in the gamma band for short ITI and small $\Delta$F conditions. Fourth, the amplitude adaptation and phase-locking adaptation were co-modulated in a within-second time scale, while this co-modulation was not observed in a multi-second time scale. These findings suggest that the amplitude and phase-locking adaptations have different mechanisms and functions. The phase-locking adaptation is likely to play more crucial roles in encoding a temporal structure of stimulus than the amplitude adaptation.},

  abstract = {Despite the widespread use of current-source density (CSD) analysis of extracellular potential recordings in the brain, the physical mechanisms responsible for the generation of the signal are still debated. While the extracellular potential is thought to be exclusively generated by the transmembrane currents, recent studies suggest that extracellular diffusive, advective and displacement currents\textemdash{}traditionally neglected\textemdash{}may also contribute considerably towards extracellular potential recordings. Here, we first justify the application of the electro-quasistatic approximation of Maxwell's equations to describe the electromagnetic field of physiological origin. Subsequently, we perform spatial averaging of currents in neural tissue to arrive at the notion of the CSD and derive an equation relating it to the extracellular potential. We show that, in general, the extracellular potential is determined by the CSD of membrane currents as well as the gradients of the putative extracellular diffusion current. The diffusion current can contribute significantly to the extracellular potential at frequencies less than a few Hertz; in which case it must be subtracted to obtain correct CSD estimates. We also show that the advective and displacement currents in the extracellular space are negligible for physiological frequencies while, within cellular membrane, displacement current contributes toward the CSD as a capacitive current. Taken together, these findings elucidate the relationship between electric currents and the extracellular potential in brain tissue and form the necessary foundation for the analysis of extracellular recordings.

  abstract = {Humans can detect regular patterns very rapidly (i.e., within a few cycles) without any special attention to the acoustic environment. This suggests that human sensory systems are equipped with a powerful mechanism for the automatic prediction of forthcoming stimuli in order to detect regularity. It has recently been hypothesized that the neural basis of sensory predictions exist not only for what happens (predictive coding), but also for when a particular stimulus occurs (predictive timing). We here hypothesized that the phase of neural oscillations is critical in predictive timing and that these oscillations are modulated in a band-specific manner when acoustic patterns become predictable, i.e., regular. A high-density microelectrode array (10 x 10 within 4 x 4 mm2) characterized spatial patterns of band-specific oscillations when a random tone sequence was switched to a regular tone sequence. Increasing the regularity of tone sequence enhanced the phase locking in a band-specific manner, irrespective of the type of regular sound pattern: gamma-band phase locking increased immediately after the transition from random to regular sequences, while beta-band phase locking gradually evolved with time after the transition. The amplitude of the tone-evoked response, on the other hand, increased with frequency separation with respect to the prior tone, suggesting that the evoked-response amplitude encodes the sequence information on a local scale, i.e., the local order of tones. In terms of a spatial pattern, the phase-locking modulation spread widely over the auditory cortex, while the amplitude modulation was locally confined around the activation foci. Thus, our data suggest that oscillatory phase, rather than amplitude, plays a more important role in neuronal detection of tone sequence regularity, which is closely related to predictive timing. Furthermore, their band-specific contributions may support the recent theories that the gamma oscillations encode bottom-up prediction error, whereas the beta oscillations are involved in top-down prediction.},

Three of the four comparison methods are based on the well known, classical batch k-means model. Specifically, we use k-means, single pass k-means, online k-means, and clustering using representatives (CURE) for numerical comparisons. clusiVAT is based on sampling the data, imaging the reordered distance matrix to estimate the number of clusters in the data visually, clustering the samples using a relative of single linkage (SL), and then noniteratively extending the labels to the rest of the data-set using the nearest prototype rule. Previous work has established that clusiVAT produces true SL clusters in compact-separated data. We have performed experiments to show that k-means and its modified algorithms suffer from initialization issues that cause many failures. On the other hand, clusiVAT needs no initialization, and almost always finds partitions that accurately match ground truth labels in labeled data. CURE also finds SL type partitions but is much slower than the other four algorithms. In our experiments, clusiVAT proves to be the fastest and most accurate of the five algorithms; e.g., it recovers 97\% of the ground truth labels in the real world KDD-99 cup data (4292637 samples in 41 dimensions) in 76 s.},

  shorttitle = {Fuzzy C-{{Shape}}},
  abstract = {The existence of large volumes of time series data in many applications has motivated data miners to investigate specialized methods for mining time series data. Clustering is a popular data mining method due to its powerful exploratory nature and its usefulness as a preprocessing step for other data mining techniques. This article develops two novel clustering algorithms for time series data that are extensions of a crisp c-shapes algorithm. The two new algorithms are heuristic derivatives of fuzzy c-means (FCM). Fuzzy c-Shapes plus (FCS+) replaces the inner product norm in the FCM model with a shape-based distance function. Fuzzy c-Shapes double plus (FCS++) uses the shape-based distance, and also replaces the FCM cluster centers with shape-extracted prototypes. Numerical experiments on 48 real time series data sets show that the two new algorithms outperform state-of-the-art shape-based clustering algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Four external cluster validity indices (the Rand index, Adjusted Rand Index, Variation of Information, and Normalized Mutual Information) are used to match candidate partitions generated by each of the studied algorithms. All four indices agree that for these finite waveform data sets, FCS++ gives a small improvement over FCS+, and in turn, FCS+ is better than the original crisp c-shapes method. Finally, we apply two tests of statistical significance to the three algorithms. The Wilcoxon and Friedman statistics both rank the three algorithms in exactly the same way as the four cluster validity indices.},

  issn = {1741-2552},
  doi = {10.1088/1741-2552/aa6089},
  abstract = {Abstract Objective: Spike sorting is a fundamental preprocessing step for many neuroscience studies which rely on the analysis of spike trains. Most of the feature extraction and dimensionality reduction techniques that have been used for spike sorting give a projection subspace which is not necessarily the most discriminative one. Therefore, the clusters which appear inherently separable in some discriminative subspace may overlap if projected using conventional feature extraction approaches leading to a poor sorting accuracy especially when the noise level is high. In this paper, we propose a noise robust and unsupervised spike sorting algorithm based on learning discriminative spike features for clustering. Method: The proposed algorithm uses discriminative subspace learning to extract low dimensional and most discriminative features from the spike waveforms, and perform clustering with automatic detection of the number of the clusters. The core part of the algorithm involves iterative subspace selection using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and clustering using Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with outlier detection. A statistical test in the discriminative subspace is proposed to automatically detect the number of the clusters. Main results: Comparative results on publicly available simulated and real in-vivo datasets demonstrate that our algorithm achieves substantially improved cluster distinction leading to higher sorting accuracy and more reliable detection of clusters which are highly overlapping and not detectable using conventional feature extraction techniques such PCA or wavelets. Significance: By providing more accurate information about the activity of more number of individual neurons with high robustness to neural noise and outliers, the proposed unsupervised spike sorting algorithm facilitates more detailed and accurate analysis of single- and multi-unit activities in neuroscience and brain machine interface studies.},

  abstract = {The increase in spatiotemporal resolution of neuroimaging devices is accompanied by a trend towards more powerful multivariate analysis methods. Often it is desired to interpret the outcome of these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with paralyzed or comatose patients via brain\textendash{}computer interfaces, it is most important to accurately extract the neural processes specific to a certain mental state. These equally important but complementary objectives require different analysis methods. Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural information from data can be considered as backward models, as they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at channels the activity of which is related to the brain process under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the activity of which is statistically independent of the brain process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose a procedure for transforming backward models into forward models. This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work raises awareness for an often encountered problem and provides a theoretical basis for conducting better interpretable multivariate neuroimaging analyses.},

Modern machine learning techniques have the potential to perform better. Here we directly compared GLMs to three leading methods: feedforward neural networks, gradient boosted trees, and stacked ensembles that combine the predictions of several methods. We predicted spike counts in macaque motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices from reaching kinematics, and in rat hippocampal cells from open field location and orientation. In general, the modern methods produced far better spike predictions and were less sensitive to the preprocessing of features. XGBoost and the ensemble were the best-performing methods and worked well even on neural data with very low spike rates. This overall performance suggests that tuning curves built with GLMs are at times inaccurate and can be easily improved upon. Our publicly shared code uses standard packages and can be quickly applied to other datasets. Encoding models built with machine learning techniques more accurately predict spikes and can offer meaningful benchmarks for simpler models.},

  abstract = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.},

High voltage spindles, recorded epidurally from the sensorimotor neocortex, were correlated with single or multiple unit activity in the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. The majority of neurons or neuronal groups in the cerebellum (77.9\%) fired rhythmically and phase-locked with the high voltage spindles, either during the spike (43.2\%; n = 41) or during the wave (34.7\%; n = 33) component of the high voltage spindle. Tremor of the head and neck musculature, recorded with an accelero-meter, occurred during the high voltage spindle in approximately half of the rats. When present, rhythmic movement occurred predominantly during the wave phase of the high voltage spindle. The remaining half of the rats did not show tremor during high voltage spindles but, nevertheless, had cerebellar units that burst during the spike or wave phase of the high voltage spindle. These latter results demonstrate that phase-locked bursting of cerebellar units during high voltage spindle is independent of rhythmic movement. The findings suggest that rhythmic output from the cerebellum may contribute to the maintenance of generalized petit mal seizures.},

In our experiments, the LFP and MUA, recorded from the same electrode in macaque primary visual cortex V1 in response to drifting grating visual stimuli, were evaluated on coarse timescales ($\sim$1\textendash{}5 s) and fine timescales ($<$0.1 s). On coarse timescales, MUA and the LFP both produced sustained visual responses to optimal and non-optimal oriented visual stimuli. The sustainedness of the two signals across the population of recording sites was correlated (correlation coefficient, $\sim$0.4). At most recording sites, the MUA was at least as sustained as the LFP and significantly more sustained for optimal orientations. In previous literature, the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies was found to be more strongly correlated with the LFP than with the MUA as a result of the lack of sustained response in the MUA signal. Because we found that MUA was as sustained as the LFP, MUA may also be correlated with BOLD. On fine timescales, we computed the coherence between the LFP and MUA over the frequency range 10\textendash{}150 Hz. The LFP and MUA were weakly but significantly coherent ($\sim$0.14) in the gamma band (20\textendash{}90 Hz). The amount of gamma-band coherence was correlated with the power in the gamma band of the LFP. The data were consistent with the proposal that the LFP and MUA are generated in a noisy, resonant cortical network.},

  abstract = {KEY POINTS: We recreated in vitro the fluctuation-driven regime observed at the soma during asynchronous network activity in vivo and we studied the firing rate response as a function of the properties of the membrane potential fluctuations. We provide a simple analytical template that captures the firing response of both pyramidal neurons and various theoretical models. We found a strong heterogeneity in the firing rate response of layer V pyramidal neurons: in particular, individual neurons differ not only in their mean excitability level, but also in their sensitivity to fluctuations. Theoretical modelling suggest that this observed heterogeneity might arise from various expression levels of the following biophysical properties: sodium inactivation, density of sodium channels and spike frequency adaptation.
ABSTRACT: Characterizing the input-output properties of neocortical neurons is of crucial importance for understanding the properties emerging at the network level. In the regime of low-rate irregular firing (such as in the awake state), determining those properties for neocortical cells remains, however, both experimentally and theoretically challenging. Here, we studied this problem using a combination of theoretical modelling and in vitro experiments. We first identified, theoretically, three somatic variables that describe the dynamical state at the soma in this fluctuation-driven regime: the mean, standard deviation and time constant of the membrane potential fluctuations. Next, we characterized the firing rate response of individual layer V pyramidal cells in this three-dimensional space by means of perforated-patch recordings and dynamic clamp in the visual cortex of juvenile mice in vitro. We found that individual neurons strongly differ not only in terms of their excitability, but also, and unexpectedly, in their sensitivities to fluctuations. Finally, using theoretical modelling, we attempted to reproduce these results. The model predicts that heterogeneous levels of biophysical properties such as sodium inactivation, sharpness of sodium activation and spike frequency adaptation account for the observed diversity of firing rate responses. Because the firing rate response will determine population rate dynamics during asynchronous neocortical activity, our results show that cortical populations are functionally strongly inhomogeneous in young mouse visual cortex, which should have important consequences on the strategies of cortical computation at early stages of sensory processing.},

However, it is not known how stimuli with complex temporal dynamics drive the dynamics of adaptation and the resulting firing rate. For single neurons, it has often been assumed that adaptation has a single time scale. We found that single rat neocortical pyramidal neurons adapt with a time scale that depends on the time scale of changes in stimulus statistics. This multiple time scale adaptation is consistent with fractional order differentiation, such that the neuron's firing rate is a fractional derivative of slowly varying stimulus parameters. Biophysically, even though neuronal fractional differentiation effectively yields adaptation with many time scales, we found that its implementation required only a few properly balanced known adaptive mechanisms. Fractional differentiation provides single neurons with a fundamental and general computation that can contribute to efficient information processing, stimulus anticipation and frequency-independent phase shifts of oscillatory neuronal firing.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Spike adaptation is a property of most neurons. When spike time adaptation occurs over multiple time scales, the dynamics can be described by a power-law. We study the computational properties of a leaky integrate-and-fire model with power-law adaptation. Instead of explicitly modeling the adaptation process by the contribution of slowly changing conductances, we use a fractional temporal derivative framework. The exponent of the fractional derivative represents the degree of adaptation of the membrane voltage, where 1 is the normal leaky integrator while values less than 1 produce increasing correlations in the voltage trace. The temporal correlation is interpreted as a memory trace that depends on the value of the fractional derivative. We identify the memory trace in the fractional model as the sum of the instantaneous differentiation weighted by a function that depends on the fractional exponent, and it provides non-local information to the incoming stimulus. The spiking dynamics of the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model show memory dependence that can result in downward or upward spike adaptation. Our model provides a framework for understanding how long-range membrane voltage correlations affect spiking dynamics and information integration in neurons.},

  abstract = {What's in this book? This book is a step backwards, to four classical methods for clustering in small, static data sets, which have all withstood the tests of time. The youngest of the four methods is now more than 40 years old:  Gaussian Mixture Decomposition (GMD, 1898) Hard c-means (HCM, 1956, often called "k-means") Fuzzy c-means (FCM, 1973, reduces to HCM in a certain limit)  SAHN Clustering (principally single linkage (SL, 1909))~~~~~~~~  The dates shown are the first known writing (to me, anyway) about these four models. There are many different algorithms that attempt to optimize the first three models, which all define good clusters as part of extrema of optimization problems defined by their objective functions. The SAHN models are deterministic, and operate in a very different way.  The expansion of cluster analysis into every corner of our modern lives (big data, social networks, streaming video, wireless sensor networks, ... the list is endless) still rests on the foundation provided by these four models. I am (with apologies to Marvel Comics) very comfortable in calling HCM, FCM, GMD and SL the fantastic four.  As in many branches of information technology, this is a vast topic. The overall picture in clustering is quite overwhelming, so any attempt to swim at the deep end of the pool in even a very specialized subfield requires a lot of training. But we all start out at the shallow end (or at least that's where we should start!), and this book is aimed squarely at teaching toddlers not to be afraid of the water. With the exception of Chapter 10, there is not a section of this book that, if explored in real depth, cannot be expanded into its own volume. So, if your needs are for an in-depth treatment of all the latest developments in any topic in this volume, the best I can do \textendash{} what I will try to do anyway - is lead you to the pool, and show you where to jump in. If you are a graduate student, professor, or professional in computational science or engineering, you may already know more than this book contains, so it won't be very useful to you. My hope is that this volume will be useful to the real novice, who thinks that clustering might be a good thing to try, but who knows very little about it. To close this part of the introduction, I repeat a cautionary statement made by Marriott (1974) about the dangers of believing what a computer tells you about clusters your data:  ``If the results disagree with informed opinion, do not admit a simple logical interpretation, and do not show up clearly in a graphical presentation, they are probably wrong. There is no magic about numerical methods, and many ways in which they can break down. They are a valuable aid to the interpretation of data, not sausage machines automatically transforming bodies of numbers into packets of scientific fact.''  \mbox{}Jim received the PhD in Applied Mathematics from Cornell University in 1973.

  abstract = {For decades it has been hypothesized that molecules within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diffuse into the brain parenchyma and influence the function of neurons. However, the functional consequences of CSF on neuronal circuits are largely unexplored and unknown. A major reason for this is the absence of appropriate neuronal in vitro model systems, and it is uncertain if neurons cultured in pure CSF survive and preserve electrophysiological functionality in vitro. In this article we present an approach to address how human CSF (hCSF) influences neuronal circuits in vitro. We validate our approach by comparing the morphology, viability, and electrophysiological function of single neurons and at the network level in rat organotypic slice and primary neuronal cultures cultivated either in hCSF or in defined standard culture media. Our results demonstrate that rodent hippocampal slices and primary neurons cultured in hCSF maintain neuronal morphology and preserve synaptic transmission. Importantly, we show that hCSF increases neuronal viability and the number of electrophysiologically active neurons in comparison to the culture media. In summary, our data indicate that hCSF represents a physiological environment for neurons in vitro and a superior culture condition compared to the defined standard media. Moreover, this experimental approach paves the way to assess the functional consequences of CSF on neuronal circuits as well as suggesting a novel strategy for CNS disease modeling.},

  abstract = {The performance of complex networks, like the brain, depends on how effectively their elements communicate. Despite the importance of communication, it is virtually unknown how information is transferred in local cortical networks, consisting of hundreds of closely spaced neurons. To address this, it is important to record simultaneously from hundreds of neurons at a spacing that matches typical axonal connection distances, and at a temporal resolution that matches synaptic delays. We used a 512-electrode array (60 $\mu$m spacing) to record spontaneous activity at 20 kHz from up to 500 neurons simultaneously in slice cultures of mouse somatosensory cortex for 1 h at a time. We applied a previously validated version of transfer entropy to quantify information transfer. Similar to in vivo reports, we found an approximately lognormal distribution of firing rates. Pairwise information transfer strengths also were nearly lognormally distributed, similar to reports of synaptic strengths. Some neurons transferred and received much more information than others, which is consistent with previous predictions. Neurons with the highest outgoing and incoming information transfer were more strongly connected to each other than chance, thus forming a ``rich club.'' We found similar results in networks recorded in vivo from rodent cortex, suggesting the generality of these findings. A rich-club structure has been found previously in large-scale human brain networks and is thought to facilitate communication between cortical regions. The discovery of a small, but information-rich, subset of neurons within cortical regions suggests that this population will play a vital role in communication, learning, and memory.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Many studies have focused on communication networks between cortical brain regions. In contrast, very few studies have examined communication networks within a cortical region. This is the first study to combine such a large number of neurons (several hundred at a time) with such high temporal resolution (so we can know the direction of communication between neurons) for mapping networks within cortex. We found that information was not transferred equally through all neurons. Instead, $\sim$70\% of the information passed through only 20\% of the neurons. Network models suggest that this highly concentrated pattern of information transfer would be both efficient and robust to damage. Therefore, this work may help in understanding how the cortex processes information and responds to neurodegenerative diseases.},

* The cerebrospinal fluid contains numerous neuromodulators at ambient levels but whether, and how, they affect the activity of central neurons is unknown.

* This study provides experimental evidence that human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF) increases the excitability of hippocampal and neocortical pyramidal neurons.

* Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in hCSF displayed lowered firing thresholds, depolarized resting membrane potentials and reduced input resistance, mimicking properties of pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo.

* The excitability-increasing effect of hCSF on CA1 pyramidal neurons was entirely occluded by intracellular application of GTP$\gamma$S, suggesting that neuromodulatory effects were mediated by G-protein coupled receptors.

Abstract

The composition of brain extracellular fluid is shaped by a continuous exchange of substances between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid. The CSF is known to contain a wide range of endogenous neuromodulatory substances, but their collective influence on neuronal activity has been poorly investigated. We show here that replacing artificial CSF (aCSF), routinely used for perfusion of brain slices in vitro, with human CSF (hCSF) powerfully boosts spontaneous firing of CA1, CA3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat brain slice. CA1 pyramidal neurons in hCSF display lowered firing thresholds, more depolarized resting membrane potentials and reduced input resistance, mimicking properties of pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo. The increased excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons was completely occluded by intracellular application of GTP$\gamma$S, suggesting that endogenous neuromodulators in hCSF act on G-protein coupled receptors to enhance excitability. We found no increase in spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission by hCSF, indicating a differential effect on glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Our findings highlight a previously unknown function of the CSF in promoting spontaneous excitatory activity, and may help to explain differences observed in the activity of pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo and in vitro.},

In both cases, the extremizing solutions are shown to be fixed points of a certain operator T on the class of fuzzy, k-partitions of X, and simple iteration of T provides an algorithm which has the descent property relative to the least squared error criterion function. In the first case, the range of T consists largely of ordinary (i.e. non-fuzzy) partitions of X and the associated iteration scheme is essentially the well known ISODATA process of Ball and Hall. However, in the second case, the range of T consists mainly of fuzzy partitions and the associated algorithm is new; when X consists of k compact well separated (CWS) clusters, Xi , this algorithm generates a limiting partition with membership functions which closely approximate the characteristic functions of the clusters Xi . However, when X is not the union of k CWS clusters, the limiting partition is truly fuzzy in the sense that the values of its component membership functions differ substantially from 0 or 1 over certain regions of X. Thus, unlike ISODATA, the ``fuzzy'' algorithm signals the presence or absence of CWS clusters in X. Furthermore, the fuzzy algorithm seems significantly less prone to the ``cluster-splitting'' tendency of ISODATA and may also be less easily diverted to uninteresting locally optimal partitions. Finally, for data sets X consisting of dense CWS clusters embedded in a diffuse background of strays, the structure of X is accurately reflected in the limiting partition generated by the fuzzy algorithm. Mathematical arguments and numerical results are offered in support of the foregoing assertions.},

Experimental results also suggest that intercluster separation plays a more important role in cluster validation than cluster diameter.

  abstract = {We review two clustering algorithms (hard c-means and single linkage) and three indexes of crisp cluster validity (Hubert's statistics, the Davies-Bouldin index, and Dunn's index). We illustrate two deficiencies of Dunn's index which make it overly sensitive to noisy clusters and propose several generalizations of it that are not as brittle to outliers in the clusters. Our numerical examples show that the standard measure of interset distance (the minimum distance between points in a pair of sets) is the worst (least reliable) measure upon which to base cluster validation indexes when the clusters are expected to form volumetric clouds. Experimental results also suggest that intercluster separation plays a more important role in cluster validation than cluster diameter. Our simulations show that while Dunn's original index has operational flaws, the concept it embodies provides a rich paradigm for validation of partitions that have cloud-like clusters. Five of our generalized Dunn's indexes provide the best validation results for the simulations presented},

It describes techniques that use trajectory data to define a general set of activities that are applicable to a wide range of scenes and environments.

The scene topology is automatically learned and is distinguished by points of interest and motion characterized by activity paths. The methods we review are intended for real-time surveillance through definition of a diverse set of events for further analysis triggering, including virtual fencing, speed profiling, behavior classification, anomaly detection, and object interaction.},

  abstract = {Understanding plasticity of neural networks is a key to comprehending their development and function. A powerful technique to study neural plasticity includes recording and control of pre- and postsynaptic neural activity, e.g., by using simultaneous intracellular recording and stimulation of several neurons. Intracellular recording is, however, a demanding technique and has its limitations in that only a small number of neurons can be stimulated and recorded from at the same time. Extracellular techniques offer the possibility to simultaneously record from larger numbers of neurons with relative ease, at the expenses of increased efforts to sort out single neuronal activities from the recorded mixture, which is a time consuming and error prone step, referred to as spike sorting. In this mini-review, we describe recent technological developments in two separate fields, namely CMOS-based high-density microelectrode arrays, which also allow for extracellular stimulation of neurons, and real-time spike sorting. We argue that these techniques, when combined, will provide a powerful tool to study plasticity in neural networks consisting of several thousand neurons in vitro.},

  abstract = {The problem of user authentication is a crucial component of many solutions related to defense and security. The identification and verification of users allows the implementation of technologies and services oriented to the intended user and to prevent misuse by illegitimate users. It has become an essential part of many systems and it is used in several applications, particularly in the military. The handwritten signature is an element intrinsically endowed with specificity related to an individual and it has been used extensively as a key element in identification/authentication. Haptic technologies allow the use of additional information like kinesthetic and tactile feedback from the user, thus providing new sources of biometric information that can be incorporated within the process in addition to the traditional image-based sources. While work had been done on using haptic information for the analysis of handwritten signatures, most efforts have been oriented to the direct use of machine learning techniques for identification/verification. Comparatively fewer targeted information visualization and understanding the internal structure of the data. Here a variety of techniques are used for obtaining representations of the data in low dimensional spaces amenable to visual inspection (two and three dimensions). The approach is unsupervised, although for illustration and comparison purposes, class information is used as qualitative reference. Estimations of the intrinsic dimension for the haptic data are obtained which shows that low dimensional subspaces contains most of the data structure. Implicit and explicit mappings techniques transforming the original high dimensional data to low dimensional spaces are considered. They include linear and nonlinear, classical and computational intelligence based methods: Principal Components, Sammon mapping, Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding, Spectral Embedding, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding, Generative Topographic Mapping, Neuroscale and Genetic Programming. They provided insight about common and specific characteristics found in haptic signatures, their within/among subjects variability and the important role of certain types of haptic variables. The results obtained suggest ways how to design new representations for identification and verification procedures using tactile devices.},

In this paper, we present an efficient formulation of the iVAT algorithm which reduces the computational complexity of the iVAT algorithm from O(N3) to O(N2). We also prove a direct relationship between the VAT image and the iVAT image produced by our efficient formulation. We conclude with three examples displaying clustering tendencies in three of the Karypis data sets that illustrate the improvement offered by the iVAT transformation. We also provide a comparison of iVAT images to those produced by the Reverse Cuthill-Mckee (RCM) algorithm; our examples suggest that iVAT is superior to the RCM method of display.},

  abstract = {Personal computing technologies are everywhere; hence, there are an abundance of staggeringly large data sets-the Library of Congress has stored over 160 terabytes of web data and it is estimated that Facebook alone logs nearly a petabyte of data per day. Thus, there is a pertinent need for systems by which one can elucidate the similarity and dissimilarity among and between groups in these big data sets. Clustering is one way to find these groups. In this paper, we extend the scalable Visual Assessment of Tendency (sVAT) algorithm to return single-linkage partitions of big data sets. The sVAT algorithm is designed to provide visual evidence of the number of clusters in unloadable (big) data sets. The extension we describe for sVAT enables it to also then efficiently return the data partition as indicated by the visual evidence. The computational complexity and storage requirements of sVAT are (usually) significantly less than the O(n2) requirement of the classic single-linkage hierarchical algorithm. We show that sVAT is a scalable instantiation of single-linkage clustering for data sets that contain c compact-separated clusters, where c $\ll$ n; n is the number of objects. For data sets that do not contain compact-separated clusters, we show that sVAT produces a good approximation of single-linkage partitions. Experimental results are presented for both synthetic and real data sets.},

Because principal cells and GABAergic interneurons contribute differently to cortical operations, their experimental identification and separation is of utmost important. We used 64-site two-dimensional silicon probes for high-density recording of local neurons in layer 5 of the somatosensory and prefrontal cortices of the rat. Multiple-site monitoring of units allowed for the determination of their two-dimensional spatial position in the brain. Of the approximately 60,000 cell pairs recorded, 0.2\% showed robust short-term interactions. Units with significant, short-latency ($<$3 ms) peaks following their action potentials in their cross-correlograms were characterized as putative excitatory (pyramidal) cells. Units with significant suppression of spiking of their partners were regarded as putative GABAergic interneurons. A portion of the putative interneurons was reciprocally connected with pyramidal cells. Neurons physiologically identified as inhibitory and excitatory cells were used as templates for classification of all recorded neurons. Of the several parameters tested, the duration of the unfiltered (1 Hz to 5 kHz) spike provided the most reliable clustering of the population. High-density parallel recordings of neuronal activity, determination of their physical location and their classification into pyramidal and interneuron classes provide the necessary tools for local circuit analysis.},

  abstract = {In general, the inter-word dissimilarity measure supplied by Dynamic Time Warping algorithms can not be assumed to be a metric because it does not fully satisfy all the required properties (the triangle inequality in particular). In this paper, however, empirical evidence of loose satisfaction of these properties with real speech will be presented, allowing the assumption of a ``loose metric space'' structure in the set of parametric representations of words in a given vocabulary. Based on this structure, a search algorithm will be introduced which eliminates the need of computing the DTW-distance between the test word and many of the prototypes in the dictionary for Isolated Word Recognition. Experiments with vocabularies of different characteristics, have proved that the algorithm finds the nearest prototype by performing DTW computations with an average of only 30\% of the words in the dictionary. This figure has been observed to decrease with increasing dictionary size, and also if the test word is close to the corresponding prototype (``well uttered'' word). Das sich aus der Anwendung des dynamischen Zeitverzerrungsalgorithmus (DTW0 ergebende Un{\"a}hnlichkeitsma$\beta$ zwischen W{\"o}rten kann im allgemeinen nicht als Metrik betrachtet werden, da es nicht alle erforderlichen Eigenschaften besitzt (insbesondere die Eigenschaft der Dreiecksungleichung). In diesem Beitrag wird jedoch eine ann{\"a}hernde Erf{\"u}llung dieser Eigenschaften im nat{\"u}rlichen Sprachsignal empirisch nachgewiesen. Die erlaubt die Annahme einer ``losen'' metrischen Struktur innerhalb des Raumes der parametrischen Darstellungen der W{\"o}rter eines Wortschatzes f{\"u}r ein Einzelworterkennungssystem. Gest{\"u}tzt auf diese Struktur, wird ein Suchalgorithms eingef{\"u}hrt, welcher die Berechnung der DTW-Distanz zwischen dem Testwort und vielen Prototypen im Lexikon {\"u}berfl{\"u}ssig macht.

Diese Zahl nimmit bei steigendes Lexikonumfang sowie zunehmender {\"A}hnlichkeit des Testwortes mit einem entsprechenden Prototyp (bewu$\beta$t ``korrekt'' ausgesprochenes Wort) ab.

We introduce a new clustering based anomaly detection framework named iVAT+ and clusiVAT+ and use it for trajectory anomaly detection. This approach is based on partitioning the VAT-generated Minimum Spanning Tree based on an efficient thresholding scheme. The trajectories are classified as normal or anomalous based on the number of paths in the clusters. On synthetic datasets with fixed and variable numbers of clusters and anomalies, we achieve 98 \% classification accuracy. Our two-stage clusiVAT method is applied to 26,039 trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians from a parking lot scene from the real life MIT trajectories dataset. The first stage clusters the trajectories ignoring directionality. The second stage divides the clusters obtained from the first stage by considering trajectory direction. We show that our novel two-stage clusiVAT approach can produce natural and informative trajectory clusters on this real life dataset while finding representative anomalies.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of laboratories are studying population properties of the nervous system using data where the spike activity of more than one neuron is recorded on each electrode and where, accidentally or deliberately, these activities are not resolved into single unit spike trains. We have previously examined the consequences for measurement of cross-correlation between two such electrodes in the limited case where all individual distant (between electrode) correlations are the same and all individual close (on a single electrode) correlations are the same [Bedenbaugh, P.H., and Gerstein, G.L. (1997). Multiunit normalized cross correlation differs from the average single-unit normalized correlation. Neural Computation 9, 1265\textendash{}1275]. Here, we lift these unrealistic restrictions to allow all values of individual correlation, and examine explicitly the cases of two or three unresolved neurons on each electrode. In these situations, the cross-correlation coefficient measured between the electrodes is a linear sum of the distant correlations, divided by a non-linear function of the close correlations. We then examine in detail the case of a single direct distant correlation and take account of all relevant indirect correlations. The measured interelectrode correlation shows a reduction of this actual distant correlation by a non-linear function of the close correlations on each electrode over most of their possible values. Finally, we examine the consequences of poor waveform sorting for correlation measures; here a supposedly isolated spike train is contaminated by some fraction of the activity of another train, a situation that unfortunately is all too common in experiments. All these distortions become far more serious in the more realistic situation of dynamic firing rates and correlations. This paper is intended as a cautionary note for those who want to draw inferences about neuronal organization and/or coding or representation by using cross-correlation analysis of unresolved recordings.},

Strong inferences about neural computation are made from the results of such studies, so it is important that these results be accurate. However, the preliminary step in the analysis of such data, the assignment of spike waveforms to individual neurons (``spike-sorting''), makes a critical assumption which undermines the analysis: that spikes, and hence neurons, are independent. We show that this assumption guarantees that coincident spiking estimates such as correlation coefficients are biased. We also show how to eliminate this bias. Our solution involves sorting spikes jointly, which contrasts with the current practice of sorting spikes independently of other spikes. This new ``ensemble sorting'' yields unbiased estimates of coincident spiking, and permits more data to be analyzed with confidence, improving the quality and quantity of neurophysiological inferences. These results should be of interest outside the context of neuronal correlations studies. Indeed, simultaneous recording of many neurons has become the rule rather than the exception in experiments, so it is essential to spike sort correctly if we are to make valid inferences about any properties of, and relationships between, neurons.},

These spike-waveform changes make single-neuron identification difficult, particularly when the activities of multiple neurons are simultaneously recorded with a multichannel microelectrode, such as a tetrode or a heptode. We have developed a tracking method of individual neurons despite their changing spike amplitudes. The method is based on a bottom-up hierarchical clustering algorithm that tracks each neuron's spike cluster during temporally overlapping clustering periods. We evaluated this method by comparing spike sorting with and without cluster tracking of an identical series of multineuronal spikes recorded from monkey area-TE neurons responding to a set of visual stimuli. According to Shannon's information theory, errors in spike-amplitude tracking reduce the expected value of the amount of information about a stimulus set that is transferred by the spike train of a cluster. In this study, cluster tracking significantly increased the expected value of the amount of information transferred by a spike train (p$<$0.01). Additionally, the stability of the stimulus preference and that of the cross-correlation between clusters improved significantly (p$<$0.000001). We conclude that cluster tracking improves the quality of multineuronal data analysis},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.12.006},
  abstract = {Background
Computationally efficient spike recognition methods are required for real-time analysis of extracellular neural recordings. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is important to human health but less well-understood with few appropriate spike recognition algorithms due to large waveform variability.
New method
Here we present a method based on dynamic time warping (DTW) with high tolerance to variability in time and magnitude. Adaptive temporal gridding for ``fastDTW'' in similarity calculation significantly reduces the computational cost. The automated threshold selection allows for real-time classification for extracellular recordings.
Results
Our method is first evaluated on synthesized data at different noise levels, improving both classification accuracy and computational complexity over the conventional cross-correlation based template-matching method (CCTM) and PCA + k-means clustering without time warping. Our method is then applied to analyze the mouse enteric neural recording with mechanical and chemical stimuli. Successful classification of biphasic and monophasic spikes is achieved even when the spike variability is larger than millisecond in width and millivolt in magnitude.
Comparison with existing method(s)
In comparison with conventional template matching and clustering methods, the fastDTW method is computationally efficient with high tolerance to waveform variability.
Conclusions
We have developed an adaptive fastDTW algorithm for real-time spike classification of ENS recording with large waveform variability against colony motility, ambient changes and cellular heterogeneity.},

Since the discrimination algorithms used by experimenters to isolate cells from extracellular recordings are based on differences in waveforms, we show how these systematic changes in waveform shape can lead to non-random errors in single cell isolation. We further demonstrate that these non-random errors can lead to apparent temporal ordering effects between neurons in the absence of any specific temporal relationship. A firm understanding of these naturally occurring physiological changes is therefore critical for the evaluation of higher order phenomena such as the temporally correlated firing of ensembles of neurons.},

Our approach is based on template matching which is an optimal filter under Gaussian noise. However, this is usually expensive in terms of computational time, and constructing appropriate templates can be also problematic. Despite its theoretical consistency, only a few algorithms have been proposed to efficiently solve this problem. To speed up the filter, it is important to curtail the matching process when the distance between the template and waveform exceeds some threshold. We approach this aspect of the problem using Davies-Bouldin validation indices (DBVIs), which are a function of the ratio of the sum of within-cluster scatter to between-cluster separation to prioritize point-by-point calculation. The templates are also constructed automatically by combining principle component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering. This matching process performed well, with a shorter computational time and fewer incorrect classifications than other ordering methods.},

  abstract = {Background
Extracellular recordings are performed by inserting electrodes in the brain, relaying the signals to external power-demanding devices, where spikes are detected and sorted in order to identify the firing activity of different putative neurons. A main caveat of these recordings is the necessity of wires passing through the scalp and skin in order to connect intracortical electrodes to external amplifiers. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of an implantable platform (i.e. a chip) with the capability to wirelessly transmit the neural signals and perform real-time on-site spike sorting.
New method
We computationally modelled a two-stage implementation for online, robust, and efficient spike sorting. In the first stage, spikes are detected on-chip and streamed to an external computer where mean templates are created and sent back to the chip. In the second stage, spikes are sorted in real-time through template matching.
Results
We evaluated this procedure using realistic simulations of extracellular recordings and describe a set of specifications that optimise performance while keeping to a minimum the signal requirements and the complexity of the calculations.
Comparison with existing methods
A key bottleneck for the development of long-term BMIs is to find an inexpensive method for real-time spike sorting. Here, we simulated a solution to this problem that uses both offline and online processing of the data.
Conclusions
Hardware implementations of this method therefore enable low-power long-term wireless transmission of multiple site extracellular recordings, with application to wireless BMIs or closed-loop stimulation designs.},

  abstract = {Synchronous spike discharge of cortical neurons is thought to be a fingerprint of neuronal cooperativity. Because neighboring neurons are more densely connected to one another than neurons that are located further apart, near-synchronous spike discharge can be expected to be prevalent and it might provide an important basis for cortical computations. Using microelectrodes to record local groups of neurons does not allow for the reliable separation of synchronous spikes from different cells, because available spike sorting algorithms cannot correctly resolve the temporally overlapping waveforms. We show that high spike sorting performance of in vivo recordings, including overlapping spikes, can be achieved with a recently developed filter-based template matching procedure. Using tetrodes with a three-dimensional structure, we demonstrate with simulated data and ground truth in vitro data, obtained by dual intracellular recording of two neurons located next to a tetrode, that the spike sorting of synchronous spikes can be as successful as the spike sorting of nonoverlapping spikes and that the spatial information provided by multielectrodes greatly reduces the error rates. We apply the method to tetrode recordings from the prefrontal cortex of behaving primates, and we show that overlapping spikes can be identified and assigned to individual neurons to study synchronous activity in local groups of neurons.},

  abstract = {Synchronous spike discharge of cortical neurons is thought to be a fingerprint of neuronal cooperativity. Because neighboring neurons are more densely connected to one another than neurons that are located further apart, near-synchronous spike discharge can be expected to be prevalent and it might provide an important basis for cortical computations. Using microelectrodes to record local groups of neurons does not allow for the reliable separation of synchronous spikes from different cells, because available spike sorting algorithms cannot correctly resolve the temporally overlapping waveforms. We show that high spike sorting performance of in vivo recordings, including overlapping spikes, can be achieved with a recently developed filter-based template matching procedure. Using tetrodes with a three-dimensional structure, we demonstrate with simulated data and ground truth in vitro data, obtained by dual intracellular recording of two neurons located next to a tetrode, that the spike sorting of synchronous spikes can be as successful as the spike sorting of nonoverlapping spikes and that the spatial information provided by multielectrodes greatly reduces the error rates. We apply the method to tetrode recordings from the prefrontal cortex of behaving primates, and we show that overlapping spikes can be identified and assigned to individual neurons to study synchronous activity in local groups of neurons.},

  abstract = {Understanding the function of complex cortical circuits requires the simultaneous recording of action potentials from many neurons in awake and behaving animals. Practically, this can be achieved by extracellularly recording from multiple brain sites using single wire electrodes. However, in densely packed neural structures such as the human hippocampus, a single electrode can record the activity of multiple neurons. Thus, analytic techniques that differentiate action potentials of different neurons are required. Offline spike sorting approaches are currently used to detect and sort action potentials after finishing the experiment. Because the opportunities to record from the human brain are relatively rare, it is desirable to analyze large numbers of simultaneous recordings quickly using online sorting and detection algorithms. In this way, the experiment can be optimized for the particular response properties of the recorded neurons. Here we present and evaluate a method that is capable of detecting and sorting extracellular single-wire recordings in realtime. We demonstrate the utility of the method by applying it to an extensive data set we acquired from chronically implanted depth electrodes in the hippocampus of human epilepsy patients. This dataset is particularly challenging because it was recorded in a noisy clinical environment. This method will allow the development of ``closed-loop'' experiments, which immediately adapt the experimental stimuli and/or tasks to the neural response observed.},

  abstract = {The impact of a given neuronal pathway depends on the number of synapses it makes with its postsynaptic target, the strength of each individual synapse, and the integrative properties of the postsynaptic dendrites. Here we explore the cellular and synaptic mechanisms responsible for the differential excitatory drive from the entorhinal cortical pathway onto mouse CA2 compared with CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs). Although both types of neurons receive direct input from entorhinal cortex onto their distal dendrites, these inputs produce a 5- to 6-fold larger EPSP at the soma of CA2 compared with CA1 PNs, which is sufficient to drive action potential output from CA2 but not CA1. Experimental and computational approaches reveal that dendritic propagation is more efficient in CA2 than CA1 as a result of differences in dendritic morphology and dendritic expression of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih). Furthermore, there are three times as many cortical inputs onto CA2 compared with CA1 PN distal dendrites. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that the differences in dendritic properties of CA2 compared with CA1 PNs are necessary to enable the CA2 PNs to generate their characteristically large EPSPs in response to their cortical inputs; in contrast, CA1 dendritic properties limit the size of the EPSPs they generate, even to a similar number of cortical inputs. Thus, the matching of dendritic integrative properties with the density of innervation is crucial for the differential processing of information from the direct cortical inputs by CA2 compared with CA1 PNs.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recent discoveries have shown that the long-neglected hippocampal CA2 region has distinct synaptic properties and plays a prominent role in social memory and schizophrenia. This study addresses the puzzling finding that the direct entorhinal cortical inputs to hippocampus, which target the very distal pyramidal neuron dendrites, provide an unusually strong excitatory drive at the soma of CA2 pyramidal neurons, with EPSPs that are 5\textendash{}6 times larger than those in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We here elucidate synaptic and dendritic mechanisms that account quantitatively for the marked difference in EPSP size. Our findings further demonstrate the general importance of fine-tuning the integrative properties of neuronal dendrites to their density of synaptic innervation.},

We show that a combination of phase invariant similarity and explicit features extracted from the time series provide domain expert level classification. To facilitate this application, we investigate the cross-correlation as a general phase invariant similarity function for time series. We establish several theoretical properties of cross-correlation showing that it is intuitively appealing and algorithmically tractable, but not positive semidefinite, and therefore not generally applicable with kernel methods. As a solution we introduce a positive semidefinite similarity function with the same intuitive appeal as cross-correlation. An experimental evaluation in the astronomy domain as well as several other data sets demonstrates the performance of the kernel and related similarity functions.},

It has been hypothesized that this mechanism for neuronal communication is realized by bursts of high-frequency oscillations that are phase-coupled to a low-frequency spatially distributed coupling oscillation. This mechanism requires multiple physiologically different interacting sources, one generating the low-frequency coupling oscillation and the others generating phase-coupled high-frequency oscillations. Using human intracranial EEG (iEEG) data, we provide evidence for multiple oscillatory patterns, as characterized on the basis of their spatial maps (topographies) and their frequency spectra. In fact, we show that the spatial maps for the coupling oscillations are much more widespread than the ones for the associated phase-coupled bursts. Second, in the majority of the patterns of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), phase-coupled bursts of high-frequency activity are synchronized across brain areas. Third and last, working memory operations affect the PAC strength in a heterogeneous way: in some PAC patterns, working memory operations increase their strength, whereas in others they decrease it.},

The implication of the dorsal stream in manipulating auditory information in working memory has been recently established. However, the oscillatory dynamics within this network and its causal relationship with behavior remain undefined. Using simultaneous MEG/EEG, we show that theta oscillations in the dorsal stream predict participants' manipulation abilities during memory retention in a task requiring the comparison of two patterns differing in temporal order. We investigated the causal relationship between brain oscillations and behavior by applying theta-rhythmic TMS combined with EEG over the MEG-identified target (left intraparietal sulcus) during the silent interval between the two stimuli. Rhythmic TMS entrained theta oscillation and boosted participants' accuracy. TMS-induced oscillatory entrainment scaled with behavioral enhancement, and both gains varied with participants' baseline abilities. These effects were not seen for a melody-comparison control task and were not observed for arrhythmic TMS. These data establish theta activity in the dorsal stream as causally related to memory manipulation.

The present study aimed to characterize intranuclear LA synaptic connectivity and to test the hypothesis that differences in the spread of flow of neuronal activity may relate to spontaneous epileptiform activity occurrence.
Electrical activity was evoked through electrical microstimulation in acute human brain slices containing the LA, signals were recorded as local field potentials combined with fast optical imaging of voltage-sensitive dye fluorescence. Sites of stimulation and recording were systematically varied. Following recordings, slices were anatomically reconstructed using two-dimensional unitary slices as a reference for coronal and parasagittal planes. Local spatial patterns and spread of activity were assessed by incorporating the coordinates of electrical and optical recording sites into the respective unitary slice.
A preferential directional spread of evoked electrical signals was observed from ventral to dorsal, rostral to caudal and medial to lateral regions in the LA. No differences in spread of evoked activity were observed between spontaneously and non-spontaneously active LA slices, i.e. basic properties of evoked synaptic responses were similar in the two functional types of LA slices, including input\textendash{}output relationship, and paired-pulse depression.
These results indicate a directed propagation of synaptic signals within the human LA in spontaneously active epileptic slices. We suggest that the lack of differences in local and in systemic information processing has to be found in confined epileptiform circuits within the amygdala likely involving well-known ``epileptic neurons''.},

Although fres has been correlated to the network frequency (fnet) in a variety of systems, a causal relationship between the two has not been established. We examine the hypothesis that combinations of biophysical parameters that shift fres, without changing other attributes of the impedance profile, also shift fnet in the same direction. We test this hypothesis, computationally and experimentally, in an electrically coupled network consisting of intrinsic oscillator (O) and resonator (R) neurons. We use a two-cell model of such a network to show that increasing fres of R directly increases fnet and that this effect becomes more prominent if the amplitude of resonance is increased. Notably, the effect of fres on fnet is independent of the parameters that define the oscillator or the combination of parameters in R that produce the shift in fres, as long as this combination produces the same impedance vs. frequency relationship. We use the dynamic clamp technique to experimentally verify the model predictions by connecting a model resonator to the pacemaker pyloric dilator neurons of the crab Cancer borealis pyloric network using electrical synapses and show that the pyloric network frequency can be shifted by changing fres in the resonator. Our results provide compelling evidence that fres and resonance amplitude strongly influence fnet, and therefore, modulators may target these attributes to modify rhythmic activity.},

  abstract = {Much of neuroscience has to do with relating neural activity and behavior or environment. One common measure of this relationship is the firing rates of neurons as functions of behavioral or environmental parameters, often called tuning functions and receptive fields. Firing rates are estimated from the spike trains of neurons recorded by electrodes implanted in the brain. Individual neurons' spike trains are not typically readily available, because the signal collected at an electrode is often a mixture of activities from different neurons and noise. Extracting individual neurons' spike trains from voltage signals, which is known as spike sorting, is one of the most important data analysis problems in neuroscience, because it has to be undertaken prior to any analysis of neurophysiological data in which more than one neuron is believed to be recorded on a single electrode. All current spike-sorting methods consist of clustering the characteristic spike waveforms of neurons. The sequence of first spike sorting based on waveforms, then estimating tuning functions, has long been the accepted way to proceed. Here, we argue that the covariates that modulate tuning functions also contain information about spike identities, and that if tuning information is ignored for spike sorting, the resulting tuning function estimates are biased and inconsistent, unless spikes can be classified with perfect accuracy. This means, for example, that the commonly used peristimulus time histogram is a biased estimate of the firing rate of a neuron that is not perfectly isolated. We further argue that the correct conceptual way to view the problem out is to note that spike sorting provides information about rate estimation and vice versa, so that the two relationships should be considered simultaneously rather than sequentially. Indeed we show that when spike sorting and tuning-curve estimation are performed in parallel, unbiased estimates of tuning curves can be recovered even from imperfectly sorted neurons.},

However, when these covariates do modulate the firing rates, they provide information about spikes' identities, which thus far have been ignored for the purpose of spike sorting. This letter describes a novel approach to spike sorting, which incorporates both waveform information and tuning information obtained from the modulation of firing rates. Because it efficiently uses all the available information, this spike sorter yields lower spike misclassification rates than traditional automatic spike sorters. This theoretical result is verified empirically on several examples. The proposed method does not require additional assumptions; only its implementation is different. It essentially consists of performing spike sorting and tuning estimation simultaneously rather than sequentially, as is currently done. We used an expectation-maximization maximum likelihood algorithm to implement the new spike sorter. We present the general form of this algorithm and provide a detailed implementable version under the assumptions that neurons are independent and spike according to Poisson processes. Finally, we uncover a systematic flaw of spike sorting based on waveform information only.},

  title = {Frontiers | {{Modeling}} Realistic Extracellular Recordings of Neuronal Populations for the Purpose of Evaluating Automatic Spike-Sorting Algorithms},
  abstract = {Simultaneous recordings of thousands of extracellular spikes are now possible, using silicon-based recording devices with large numbers of electrode contacts, such as high-density multi-electrode arrays (MEA) or multi-shank laminar electrodes. With the associated increase of data amounts and complexity in such recordings, manual spike sorting is not viable. Hence, there is a dire need for validated automated spike sorting methods, able to correctly resolve spikes of single neurons, as recently reviewed [1]. \\
 \\
Automated spike sorting methods should ideally be validated against test data with known ground truth, where spiking activity of all neurons in the neuronal population is known. Such details of the underlying activity can only to some extent be acquired experimentally. One remedy is model-based simulation of extracellular recordings, as electrode position-dependent spike shapes (Figure 1a) can conveniently be modeled in a biophysically realistic way using a recently released simulation tool, LFPy (http://compneuro.umb.no/LFPy). LFPy implements a forward modeling scheme for extracellular potentials [2] in Python integrated with NEURON [3]. \\
 \\

This paradigm directly uses the spike train collected at recording electrodes from thresholding the bandpassed voltage signal. Our approach is a paradigm, not an algorithm, since it can be used with any of the current decoding algorithms, such as population vector or likelihood-based algorithms. Based on analytical results and an extensive simulation study, we show that our paradigm is comparable to, and sometimes more efficient than, the traditional approach based on well-isolated neurons and that it remains efficient even when all electrodes are severely corrupted by noise, a situation that would render spike sorting particularly difficult. Our paradigm will also save time and computational effort, both of which are crucially important for successful operation of real-time brain-machine interfaces. Indeed, in place of the lengthy spike-sorting task of the traditional approach, it involves an exact expectation EM algorithm that is fast enough that it could also be left to run during decoding to capture potential slow changes in the states of the neurons.},

For another example, ``How much of a neuron's observed spiking variability is caused by the variability of its instantaneous firing rate, and how much is caused by spike timing variability?'' However, a neuron's theoretical firing rate is not necessarily well-defined. Consequently, neuroscientific questions involving the theoretical firing rate do not have a meaning in isolation but can only be interpreted in light of additional statistical modeling choices. Ignoring this ambiguity can lead to inconsistent reasoning or wayward conclusions. We illustrate these issues with examples drawn from the neural-coding literature.},

In a companion paper we showed how a Bootstrap evaluation of the peaks in the smoothed diagonals of the JPSTH may be used to establish the likely validity of apparent time-varying correlation. As noted in earlier studies by Brody and Ben-Shaul et al., trial-to-trial variation can confound correlation and synchrony effects. In this paper we elaborate on that observation, and present a method of estimating the time-dependent trial-to-trial variation in spike trains that may exceed the natural variation displayed by Poisson and non-Poisson point processes. The statistical problem is somewhat subtle because relatively few spikes per trial are available for estimating a firing-rate function that fluctuates over time. The method developed here decomposes the spike-train variability into a stimulus-related component and a trial-specific component, allowing many degrees of freedom to characterize the former while assuming a small number suffices to characterize the latter. The Bootstrap significance test of the companion paper is then modified to accommodate these general excitability effects. This methodology allows an investigator to assess whether excitability effects are constant or time-varying, and whether they are shared by two neurons. In data from two V1 neurons we find that highly statistically significant evidence of dependency disappears after adjustment for time-varying trial-to-trial variation.},

  abstract = {Objective
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a promising technology for restoring motor ability to paralyzed patients: spiking-based BCIs have successfully been used in clinical trials to control multi-degree-of-freedom robotic devices. Current implementations of these devices require a lengthy spike-sorting step, which is an obstacle to moving this technology from the lab to the clinic. A viable alternative is to avoid spike-sorting, treating all threshold crossings of the voltage waveform on an electrode as coming from one putative neuron. It is not known, however, how much decoding information might be lost by ignoring spike identity.

Approach
We present a full analysis of the effects of spike-sorting schemes on decoding performance. Specifically, we compare how well two common decoders, the optimal linear estimator and the Kalman filter, reconstruct the arm movements of non-human primates performing reaching tasks, when receiving input from various sorting schemes. The schemes we tested included: using threshold crossings without spike-sorting; expertsorting discarding the noise; expert-sorting, including the noise as if it were another neuron; and automatic spike-sorting using waveform features. We also decoded from a joint statistical model for the waveforms and tuning curves, which does not involve an explicit spike-sorting step.

Main results
Discarding the threshold crossings that cannot be assigned to neurons degrades decoding: no spikes should be discarded. Decoding based on spike-sorted units outperforms decoding based on electrodes voltage crossings: spike-sorting is useful. The four waveform based spike-sorting methods tested here yield similar decoding efficiencies: a fast and simple method is competitive. Decoding using the joint waveform and tuning model shows promise but is not consistently superior.

Significance
Our results indicate that simple automated spikesorting performs as well as computationally or manually more intensive methods, which is crucial for clinical implementation of BCIs.},

  title = {Frontiers | {{Modeling}} Realistic Extracellular Recordings of Neuronal Populations for the Purpose of Evaluating Automatic Spike-Sorting Algorithms},
  abstract = {Simultaneous recordings of thousands of extracellular spikes are now possible, using silicon-based recording devices with large numbers of electrode contacts, such as high-density multi-electrode arrays (MEA) or multi-shank laminar electrodes. With the associated increase of data amounts and complexity in such recordings, manual spike sorting is not viable. Hence, there is a dire need for validated automated spike sorting methods, able to correctly resolve spikes of single neurons, as recently reviewed [1]. \\
 \\
Automated spike sorting methods should ideally be validated against test data with known ground truth, where spiking activity of all neurons in the neuronal population is known. Such details of the underlying activity can only to some extent be acquired experimentally. One remedy is model-based simulation of extracellular recordings, as electrode position-dependent spike shapes (Figure 1a) can conveniently be modeled in a biophysically realistic way using a recently released simulation tool, LFPy (http://compneuro.umb.no/LFPy). LFPy implements a forward modeling scheme for extracellular potentials [2] in Python integrated with NEURON [3]. \\
 \\
Test data for arbitrary electrode layouts, neuron models, noise content and spike time correlations can be produced at wish, and test data mimicking tetrode and polytrode recordings in cortex and hippocampus with realistic noise features will be presented. Additionally, finite element methods (FEM) are employed to generate test data for cases where significant effects from inhomogeneous extracellular media are present, as in recordings from cell cultures or retinal slice recordings using MEAs. \\

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a resurgence in use of the extracellularly recorded local field potential (LFP) to investigate neural network activity. To probe monosynaptic thalamic activation of cortical postsynaptic target cells, so called spike-trigger-averaged LFP (stLFP) signatures have been measured. In these experiments the cortical LFP is measured by means of multielectrodes covering several cortical lamina and averaged on spontaneous spikes of thalamocortical (TC) cells. Using a well-established forward-modeling scheme, we investigate the biophysical origin of this stLFP signature with simultaneous synaptic activation of cortical layer 4 neurons, mimicking the effect of a single afferent spike from a single TC neuron. Constrained by previously measured intracellular responses of the main postsynaptic target cell types and with biologically plausible assumptions regarding the spatial distribution of thalamic synaptic inputs into layer 4, the model predicted characteristic contributions to monosynaptic stLFP signatures both for the regular spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and the fast spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons. In particular, the FS cells generated stLFP signatures of shorter temporal duration than the RS cells. Added together, a sum of the stLFP signatures of these two principal synaptic targets of thalamocortical cells were observed to resemble experimentally measured stLFP signatures. Outside the volume targeted by TC afferents the resulting postsynaptic LFP signals were found to be sharply attenuated. This implies that such stLFP signatures provide a very local measure of thalamocortical synaptic activation, and that newly developed inverse CSD-estimation methods are needed for precise assessment of the underlying spatiotemporal current-source density (CSD) profiles.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Despite its long history and prevalent use, the proper interpretation of the extracellularly recorded local field potential (LFP) is still not fully established. Here we investigate by means of biophysical modeling the origin of the focal LFP signature of the single-axon monosynaptic thalamocortical connection as measured by spike-trigger-averaging of cortical LFPs on spontaneous spikes of thalamocortical neurons. We find that this LFP signature is well accounted for by a model assuming thalamic projections to two cortical layer-4 cell populations: one excitatory (putatively regular-spiking cells) and one inhibitory (putatively fast-spiking cells). The LFP signature is observed to decay sharply outside the cortical region receiving the thalamocortical projection, implying that it indeed provides a very local measure of thalamocortical synaptic activation.},

This disagreement has been mainly attributed to the presence of sparsely firing neurons. However, it is also possible that this is due to limitations of the spike sorting algorithms used to process the data. To address this issue, we used realistic simulations of extracellular recordings and found a relatively poor spike sorting performance for simulations containing a large number of neurons. In fact, the number of correctly identified neurons for single-channel recordings showed an asymptotic behavior saturating at about 8\textendash{}10 units, when up to 20 units were present in the data. This performance was significantly poorer for neurons with low firing rates, as these units were twice more likely to be missed than the ones with high firing rates in simulations containing many neurons. These results uncover one of the main reasons for the relatively low number of neurons found in extracellular recording and also stress the importance of further developments of spike sorting algorithms.},

We present an online spike-sorting framework that uses feature normalization and weighting to maximize the distinctiveness between different spike shapes. Furthermore, multiple criteria are applied to either facilitate or prevent cluster fusion, thereby enabling experimenters to fine-tune the sorting process. We compare our method to established unsupervised offline (Wave\_Clus (WC)) and online (OSort (OS)) algorithms by examining their performance in sorting various test datasets using two different scoring systems (AMI and the Adamos metric). Furthermore, we evaluate sorting capabilities on intra-operative recordings using established quality metrics. Compared to WC and OS, our algorithm achieved comparable or higher scores on average and produced more convincing sorting results for intra-operative datasets. Thus, the presented framework is suitable for both online and offline analysis and could substantially improve the quality of microelectrode-based data evaluation for research and clinical application.},

Often, such datasets require analysis of multiple features in a highly multidimensional space, with overlap of features and sources. The datasets generated by simultaneous recording from hundreds of neurons emitting phasic action potentials have produced the challenge of separating the recorded signals into independent data subsets (clusters) corresponding to individual signal-generating neurons. Mathematical methods have been developed over the past three decades to achieve such spike clustering, but a complete solution with fully automated cluster identification has not been achieved. We propose here a fully automated mathematical approach that identifies clusters in multidimensional space through recursion, which combats the multidimensionality of the data. Recursion is paired with an approach to dimensional evaluation, in which each dimension of a dataset is examined for its informational importance for clustering. The dimensions offering greater informational importance are given added weight during recursive clustering. To combat strong background activity, our algorithm takes an iterative approach of data filtering according to a signal-to-noise ratio metric. The algorithm finds cluster cores, which are thereafter expanded to include complete clusters. This mathematical approach can be extended from its prototype context of spike sorting to other datasets that suffer from high dimensionality and background activity.},

  abstract = {Multichannel tetrode array recording in awake behaving animals provides a powerful method to record the activity of large numbers of neurons. The power of this method could be extended if further information concerning the intracellular state of the neurons could be extracted from the extracellularly recorded signals. Toward this end, we have simultaneously recorded intracellular and extracellular signals from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons in the anesthetized rat. We found that several intracellular parameters can be deduced from extracellular spike waveforms. The width of the intracellular action potential is defined precisely by distinct points on the extracellular spike. Amplitude changes of the intracellular action potential are reflected by changes in the amplitude of the initial negative phase of the extracellular spike, and these amplitude changes are dependent on the state of the network. In addition, intracellular recordings from dendrites with simultaneous extracellular recordings from the soma indicate that, on average, action potentials are initiated in the perisomatic region and propagate to the dendrites at 1.68 m/s. Finally we determined that a tetrode in hippocampal area CA1 theoretically should be able to record electrical signals from $\sim$1,000 neurons. Of these, 60\textendash{}100 neurons should generate spikes of sufficient amplitude to be detectable from the noise and to allow for their separation using current spatial clustering methods. This theoretical maximum is in contrast to the approximately six units that are usually detected per tetrode. From this, we conclude that a large percentage of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells are silent in any given behavioral condition.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous recording from large numbers of neurons is a prerequisite for understanding their cooperative behavior. Various recording techniques and spike separation methods are being used toward this goal. However, the error rates involved in spike separation have not yet been quantified. We studied the separation reliability of ``tetrode'' (4-wire electrode)-recorded spikes by monitoring simultaneously from the same cell intracellularly with a glass pipette and extracellularly with a tetrode. With manual spike sorting, we found a trade-off between Type I and Type II errors, with errors typically ranging from 0 to 30\% depending on the amplitude and firing pattern of the cell, the similarity of the waveshapes of neighboring neurons, and the experience of the operator. Performance using only a single wire was markedly lower, indicating the advantages of multiple-site monitoring techniques over single-wire recordings. For tetrode recordings, error rates were increased by burst activity and during periods of cellular synchrony. The lowest possible separation error rates were estimated by a search for the best ellipsoidal cluster shape. Human operator performance was significantly below the estimated optimum. Investigation of error distributions indicated that suboptimal performance was caused by inability of the operators to mark cluster boundaries accurately in a high-dimensional feature space. We therefore hypothesized that automatic spike-sorting algorithms have the potential to significantly lower error rates. Implementation of a semi-automatic classification system confirms this suggestion, reducing errors close to the estimated optimum, in the range 0\textendash{}8\%.},

  abstract = {Can the adult brain assimilate a novel, topographically organized, sensory modality into its perceptual repertoire? To test this, we implemented a microstimulation-based neuroprosthesis that rats used to discriminate among infrared (IR) light sources. This system continuously relayed information from four IR sensors that were distributed to provide a panoramic view of IR sources, into primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Rats learned to discriminate the location of IR sources in $<$4 d. Animals in which IR information was delivered in spatial register with whisker topography learned the task more quickly. Further, in animals that had learned to use the prosthesis, altering the topographic mapping from IR sensor to stimulating electrode had immediate deleterious effects on discrimination performance. Multielectrode recordings revealed that S1 neurons had multimodal (tactile/IR) receptive fields, with clear preferences for those stimuli most likely to be delivered during the task. Neuronal populations predicted, with high accuracy, which stimulation pattern was present in small (75 ms) time windows. Surprisingly, when identical microstimulation patterns were delivered during an unrelated task, cortical activity in S1 was strongly suppressed. Overall, these results show that the adult mammalian neocortex can readily absorb completely new information sources into its representational repertoire, and use this information in the production of adaptive behaviors.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Understanding the potential for plasticity in the adult brain is a key goal for basic neuroscience and modern rehabilitative medicine. Our study examines one dimension of this challenge: how malleable is sensory processing in adult mammals? We implemented a panoramic infrared (IR) sensory prosthetic system in rats; it consisted of four IR sensors equally spaced around the circumference of the head of the rat. Each sensor was coupled to a microstimulating electrode placed in the somatosensory cortex of the rat. Within days, rats learned to use the prosthesis to track down items associated with IR light in their environment. This is quite promising clinically, as the largest demand for sensory prosthetic devices is in adults whose brains are already fully developed.},

Rats were implanted with cortical recording microelectrodes and spinal cord stimulating electrodes, and then injected with pentylenetetrazole to induce seizures. Seizures were detected in real time from cortical local field potentials, after which DCS was applied. This method decreased seizure episode frequency by 44\% and seizure duration by 38\%.

  abstract = {A fundamental goal in systems neuroscience is to explain animal behavior in terms of the dynamics of neural ensembles. Multielectrode techniques greatly facilitate the approach toward this goal. Aside from the fact that each experiment provides a higher yield of data as compared to single-site recordings, some questions simply cannot be addressed using only one electrode at a time. For example, only multisite recordings can determine whether different neurons respond independently to stimuli, or covary from trial to trial. The purpose of this chapter is to review methods used in multielectrode studies of the rat somatosensory system, with an emphasis on the whisker system. We present a basic toolbox of methods we have used to probe the functions of populations of somatosensory neurons in a behavioral context. The basic toolbox includes techniques for applying controlled whisker stimuli, behavioral training in tactile discrimination tasks, multielectrode recordings, reversibly inactivating specific brain areas, and analysis of the ensemble neural data. These methods have already revealed fundamental properties of the somatosensory system that would have been difficult or impossible to uncover using single-electrode recordings. For example, cortical (Zhu and Connors, 1999; Ghazanfar and Nicolelis, 2001; Diamond et al., 1992; Ghazanfar et al., 2000; Schubert et al., 2001) and thalamic (Armstrong-James and Fox, 1987; Nicolelis and Chapin, 1994) neurons have large multiwhisker receptive fields that are dynamic over poststimulus time (Nicolelis and Chapin, 1994; Ghazanfar and Nicolelis, 1999; Ghazanfar et al., 2000). These data, together with observations of supralinear summation of multiwhisker inputs (Ghazanfar and Nicolelis, 1997; Shimegi, 2000), suggest that tactile receptive field dynamics function to integrate time-varying multiwhisker inputs (Ghazanfar and Nicolelis, 2001). For example, analysis of multineuron response data revealed additional stimulus-coding properties of somatosensory ensembles. S1 ensembles code stimulus location in single-neuron temporal patterns and the relative response latencies of their neurons, but not in single-trial covariations among the neurons (Nicolelis et al., 1998; Ghazanfar et al., 2000). In S2 of the primate, on the other hand, single-trial covariations among multiple neurons did contribute significantly to coding the location of a punctate stimulus (Nicolelis et al., 1998; Ghazanfar et al., 2000). Even in S1, the contribution of coordinated firing may increase with greater stimulus complexity, because multiple whisker stimuli lead to a higher prevalence of synchronous responses between neurons in the infragranular layers of S1 than in other layers (Zhang and Alloway, 2005). Combining methods for inactivating specific neural inputs with ensemble recordings led to the further conclusion that spatiotemporal RF properties of somatosensory neurons arise not only from intrinsic local properties of neurons and their neighbor connections, but rather from interactions among multiple levels of the somatosensory system. For example, recording thalamic tactile responses in the presence and absence of cortical feedback revealed that corticofugal projections contributed to both the short- and long-latency components of ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM) responses (Krupa et al., 1999; Ghazanfar et al., 2001). These interlevel interactions were reflected in simultaneous recordings in trigeminal areas in brain stem, thalamus, and cortex, which revealed widespread oscillatory synchronization of neural firing (Nicolelis et al., 1995). The correlated activity remains even after transection of the facial nerve, which suggests that such synchronous activity is generated centrally. Although the high coherence among large populations of neurons associated with this oscillatory 7\textendash{}12 Hz brain state suggested absence seizures to a number of authors (Marescaux et al., 1992; Shaw et al., 2006; Shaw, 2007), a direct test showed that rats respond robustly to mild tactile stimulation during bouts of 7\textendash{}12 Hz oscillations in S1, contradicting the absence interpretation (Wiest and Nicolelis, 2003). Thus, widespread synchronized neural firing need not preclude perception; in fact, it can enhance aspects of sensory representation (Fontanini and Katz, 2006) as well as long-term plasticity (Erchova and Diamond, 2004). These demonstrations of fast interactions among neurons distributed across the somatosensory maps at multiple processing stages were paralleled by demonstrations of a tight coupling between the two hemispheres of S1 (Shuler et al., 2001; Wiest et al., 2005). This cross-talk challenges the classical conception of the S1 barrel cortex as an encoder for exclusively contralateral whisker activity and suggests the potential importance of bilateral interactions in S1 for whisker-guided discriminations (Krupa, 2001b; Shuler et al., 2002). Multielectrode recordings in different layers of S1 while rats performed a bilateral whisker-guided discrimination revealed that a feed-forward model of tactile signal processing cannot explain S1 response properties (Krupa et al., 2004). For example, firing rate modulations that began before tactile stimulation clearly could not be explained in terms of bottom-up propagation of a stimulus signal. Rather, other inputs to S1 must contribute to shaping the task-related responses. Similarly, tactile responses were found to vary significantly in different spontaneously occurring behavioral states (Nelson, 1996; Fanselow and Nicolelis, 1999; Moore et al., 1999; Nicolelis and Fanselow, 2002; Castro-Alamancos, 2004; Moore, 2004). These data collectively suggest that widely distributed neurons coordinate their activities on millisecond time scales, and that the functional connectivity among them can be quickly adjusted in different behavioral contexts. The preceding examples are meant to indicate the range of results that have already been achieved using multielectrode arrays (MEAs). In the following sections we present specific methods developed in the past 15 years. The examples have been selected to represent methods from each major phase of a typical study, from electrode design and surgical implantation, through ensemble recording involving somatosensory stimulation, behavioral monitoring, and reversible inactivation of specific brain areas, to analysis of the recorded many-neuron data.},

  abstract = {We examined whether excitation and inhibition are balanced in hippocampal cortical networks. Extracellular field and single-unit activity were recorded by multiple tetrodes and multisite silicon probes to reveal the timing of the activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and classes of interneurons during theta waves and sharp wave burst (SPW)-associated field ripples. The somatic and dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells was deduced from the activity of interneurons in the pyramidal layer [int(p)] and in the alveus and st. oriens [int(a/o)], respectively. Int(p) and int(a/o) discharged an average of 60 and 20$^\circ$ before the population discharge of pyramidal cells during the theta cycle, respectively. SPW ripples were associated with a 2.5-fold net increase of excitation. The discharge frequency of int(a/o) increased, decreased (``anti-SPW'' cells), or did not change (``SPW-independent'' cells) during SPW, suggesting that not all interneurons are innervated by pyramidal cells. Int(p) either fired together with (unimodal cells) or both before and after (bimodal cells) the pyramidal cell burst. During fast-ripple oscillation, the activity of interneurons in both the int(p) and int(a/o) groups lagged the maximum discharge probability of pyramidal neurons by 1\textendash{}2 msec. Network state changes, as reflected by field activity, covaried with changes in the spike train dynamics of single cells and their interactions. Summed activity of parallel-recorded interneurons, but not of pyramidal cells, reliably predicted theta cycles, whereas the reverse was true for the ripple cycles of SPWs. We suggest that network-driven excitability changes provide temporal windows of opportunity for single pyramidal cells to suppress, enable, or facilitate selective synaptic inputs.},

  abstract = {Despite many advances in the study of large-scale human functional networks, the question of timing, stability, and direction of communication between cortical regions has not been fully addressed. At the cellular level, neuronal communication occurs through axons and dendrites, and the time required for such communication is well defined and preserved. At larger spatial scales, however, the relationship between timing, direction, and communication between brain regions is less clear. Here, we use a measure of effective connectivity to identify connections between brain regions that exhibit communication with consistent timing. We hypothesized that if two brain regions are communicating, then knowledge of the activity in one region should allow an external observer to better predict activity in the other region, and that such communication involves a consistent time delay. We examine this question using intracranial electroencephalography captured from nine human participants with medically refractory epilepsy. We use a coupling measure based on time-lagged mutual information to identify effective connections between brain regions that exhibit a statistically significant increase in average mutual information at a consistent time delay. These identified connections result in sparse, directed functional networks that are stable over minutes, hours, and days. Notably, the time delays associated with these connections are also highly preserved over multiple time scales. We characterize the anatomic locations of these connections, and find that the propagation of activity exhibits a preferred posterior to anterior temporal lobe direction, consistent across participants. Moreover, networks constructed from connections that reliably exhibit consistent timing between anatomic regions demonstrate features of a small-world architecture, with many reliable connections between anatomically neighbouring regions and few long range connections. Together, our results demonstrate that cortical regions exhibit functional relationships with well-defined and consistent timing, and the stability of these relationships over multiple time scales suggests that these stable pathways may be reliably and repeatedly used for large-scale cortical communication.},

  abstract = {Axonal injury in the optic nerve is associated with retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration and irreversible loss of vision. However, inflammatory stimulation (IS) by intravitreal injection of Pam3Cys transforms RGCs into an active regenerative state enabling these neurons to survive injury and to regenerate axons into the injured optic nerve. Although morphological changes have been well studied, the functional correlates of RGCs transformed either into a de- or regenerating state at a sub-cellular level remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated the signal propagation in single intraretinal axons as well as characteristic activity features of RGCs in a naive, a degenerative or a regenerative state in ex vivo retinae one week after either optic nerve cut alone (ONC) or additional inflammatory stimulation (ONC+IS). Recordings of single RGCs using high-density microelectrode arrays demonstrate that the mean intraretinal axonal conduction velocity significantly decreased within the first week after ONC. In contrast, when ONC was accompanied by regenerative Pam3Cys treatment the mean intraretinal velocity was undistinguishable from control RGCs, indicating a protective effect on the proximal axon. Spontaneous RGC activity decreased for the two most numerous RGC types (ON- and OFF-sustained cells) within one post-operative week, but did not significantly increase in RGCs after inflammatory stimulation. The analysis of light-induced activity revealed that RGCs in ONC animals respond on average later and with fewer spikes than control RGCs. IS significantly improved the responsiveness of the two studied RGC types. These results show that the transformation into a regenerative state by IS preserves, at least transiently, the physiological functional properties of injured RGCs.},

  issn = {1733-134X},
  abstract = {Focal cortical dysplasia is a malformation of cortical development, which is the most common cause of medically refractory epilepsy in the pediatric population and the second/third most common etiology of medically intractable seizures in adults., Both genetic and acquired factors are involved in the pathogenesis of cortical dysplasia. Numerous classifications of the complex structural abnormalities of focal cortical dysplasia have been proposed \textendash{} from Taylor et al. in 1971 to the last modification of Palmini classification made by Blumcke in 2011. In general, three types of cortical dysplasia are recognized., Type I focal cortical dysplasia with mild symptomatic expression and late onset, is more often seen in adults, with changes present in the temporal lobe., Clinical symptoms are more severe in type II of cortical dysplasia usually seen in children. In this type, more extensive changes occur outside the temporal lobe with predilection for the frontal lobes., New type III is one of the above dysplasias with associated another principal lesion as hippocampal sclerosis, tumor, vascular malformation or acquired pathology during early life., Brain MRI imaging shows abnormalities in the majority of type II dysplasias and in only some of type I cortical dysplasias., The most common findings on MRI imaging include: focal cortical thickening or thinning, areas of focal brain atrophy, blurring of the gray-white junction, increased signal on T2- and FLAIR-weighted images in the gray and subcortical white matter often tapering toward the ventricle. On the basis of the MRI findings, it is possible to differentiate between type I and type II cortical dysplasia. A complete resection of the epileptogenic zone is required for seizure-free life. MRI imaging is very helpful to identify those patients who are likely to benefit from surgical treatment in a group of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy., However, in type I cortical dysplasia, MR imaging is often normal, and also in both types the lesion seen on MRI may be smaller than the seizure-generating region seen in the EEG. The abnormalities may also involve vital for life brain parts, where curative surgery will not be an option. Therefore, other diagnostic imaging techniques such as FDG PET, MEG, DTI and intra-cranial EEG are widely used to establish the diagnosis and to decide on management., With advances in both genetics and neuroimaging, we may develop a better understanding of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, which will help us to provide more successful pharmacological and/or surgical treatment in the future.},

  abstract = {Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are a common cause of epilepsy. Studies of structural MRIs and PET data in patients with MCD have found widespread changes outside the visually identified lesions. The aim of this study was to investigate diffusion changes interictally in patients with MCD and to test the hypothesis that MCD would be associated with widespread abnormalities of diffusion. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to compare objectively tissue organization in 22 patients with partial seizures and MCD, with 30 control subjects. Whole-brain DTI was acquired using echo planar imaging. Rotationally invariant anisotropy and diffusivity maps were calculated and, after normalization to Talairach space, each patient was compared with the group of control subjects using SPM. Areas of reduced anisotropy were found in 17 patients and areas of increased diffusivity in 10. Two patients had areas of increased anisotropy. There were no patients with reduced diffusivity. Areas of increased diffusivity were in general more extensive than areas of reduced anisotropy. Changes in tissue beyond the MCD, that appeared normal on conventional MRI, were found in six patients for anisotropy and nine patients for diffusivity. Both measurements showed widespread changes in tissue beyond the MCD, i.e. adding information to conventional MRI. Increased or abnormally located grey matter or pathological white matter with abnormal myelination or ectopic neurones could cause reduced anisotropy. Increased diffusivity could be caused by a defect of neurogenesis or cell loss resulting in increased extracellular space. The widespread nature of abnormalities should be considered if surgical treatment is contemplated.},

  abstract = {The comorbidity between epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a topic of growing interest. Senile plaques and tauopathy are found in epileptic human temporal lobe structures, and individuals with AD have an increased incidence of spontaneous seizures. However, why and how epilepsy is associated with enhanced AD-like pathology remains unknown. We have recently shown $\beta$-secretase-1 (BACE1) elevation associated with aberrant limbic axonal sprouting in epileptic CD1 mice. Here we sought to explore whether BACE1 upregulation affected the development of Alzheimer-type neuropathology in mice expressing mutant human APP, presenilin and tau proteins, the triple transgenic model of AD (3\texttimes{}Tg-AD). 3\texttimes{}Tg-AD mice were treated with pilocarpine or saline (i.p.) at 6\textendash{}8 months of age. Immunoreactivity (IR) for BACE1, $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) was subsequently examined at 9, 11 or 14 months of age. Recurrent convulsive seizures, as well as mossy fiber sprouting and neuronal death in the hippocampus and limbic cortex, were observed in all epileptic mice. Neuritic plaques composed of BACE1-labeled swollen/sprouting axons and extracellular A$\beta$IR were seen in the hippocampal formation, amygdala and piriform cortices of 9 month-old epileptic, but not control, 3\texttimes{}Tg-AD mice. Densities of plaque-associated BACE1 and A$\beta$IR were elevated in epileptic versus control mice at 11 and 14 months of age. p-Tau IR was increased in dentate granule cells and mossy fibers in epileptic mice relative to controls at all time points examined. Thus, pilocarpine-induced chronic epilepsy was associated with accelerated and enhanced neuritic plaque formation and altered intraneuronal p-tau expression in temporal lobe structures in 3\texttimes{}Tg-AD mice, with these pathologies occurring in regions showing neuronal death and axonal dystrophy.},

  abstract = {We compared 7T MRI to optical microscopy for the detection of abnormalities in two pediatric TSC + AED-refractory resection specimens. 3D reconstruction of microscopy slides is challenging because there are non-uniform shrinkage artifacts and deformations. Nevertheless, 2D optical microscopy of stained blocks enables visualization of sub-cellular structures ($<$10 um). At 100 um resolution, 3D MRI enables visualization of cellular layers. Thus the 2D stained blocks provide a 'ground truth' for validating the features detected via 7T protocols designed to produce optimal T1w-, T2w-, and diffusion-weighted imaging contrast. After MR acquisition, the resection en bloc specimens were sectioned and stained with/for H\&E, LFB, NFP, Smi31, and GFAP. The 7T images were reconstructed into a 3D volume and manually matched to the 2D histology slides. We show that (1) both 7T MRI and optical microscopy are sufficient to visualize cortical tubers and aberrant features in the white matter, (2) a "microtuber" in 2D stained slices is coincident with radial migration lines (RMLs) in 7T imaging and (3) diffuse abnormalities persist beyond the tuber in TSC.

This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of MR microscopy for 3D characterization of abnormalities in two pediatric TSC cases. Hence, MRI may help identify treatment response biomarkers in TSC with epilepsy. Additionally, via histology we discovered a "microtuber" in the white matter of the optic radiation, which is coincident with RMLs in MRI. Next, we will pursue 3D reconstruction of microscopy slides and higher spatial resolution MRI via limited field-of-view or super-resolution reconstruction.},

Here we report a 65-year-old man with refractory epilepsy, in whom postmortem examination revealed four-layered PMG in the left hemisphere. We carried out a histological and immunohistochemical study to clarify the nature of the myelinated band in four-layered PMG cortex. The myelinated band contained no or only few neurons. GFAP- and aquaporin-1-immunoreactive astrocytes were found in the subcortical white matter as well as in the myelinated band. By contrast, GFAP- and aquaporin-1-immunoreactive astrocytes were not found in the band of Baillarger. These findings suggest that the myelinated band in PMG cortex is not the band of Baillarger and that the immunohistochemical characteristics of astrocytes in the myelinated band in PMG cortex are similar to those of the subcortical white matter. Previous studies suggest that PMG is not a cell migration disorder but a post-migration malformation. Taken together, it is likely that the myelinated band in PMG cortex represents abnormality of axonal growth or myelination after migration has terminated.},

The cases of FCD type IIIb resulted negative for Bcl-2, whereas 4/7 cases (57.1\%) of FCD type II showed immunopositive cells. These differences in Bcl-2 expression between FCD type IIIb and FCD type II resulted statistically significant (p = 0.0088). Abnormal cortical layering, overall, represents the kind of FCD more commonly associated with seizure-related low-grade tumors, whereas FCD type II is more frequently associated with GG. The profile of CD34 and Bcl-2 expression exhibited by GG is more similar to that observed in FCD type II. Such immunoprofile suggests the existence of a common pathogenesis linking glioneuronal tumors and FCD type II.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional MRI was used to study the impact of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) on the cortical language network in patients with medically refractory TLE.
METHODS: Nineteen patients with medically refractory TLE and 11 healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. Ten patients underwent left ATL (mean age 35.2 +/- 3.8 years), and 9 underwent right ATL (mean age 35.9 +/- 2.6 years). The subjects silently generated verbs in response to a series of visually presented nouns inside the scanner. Correlation analysis was performed between the subjects' performance on the clinical language tests and their neural response in the a priori cortical regions.
RESULTS: Preoperative data revealed that the patients with TLE showed increased neural activity in the right inferior frontal gyri (IFG) and middle frontal gyri (MFG). The right TLE patients demonstrated strong correlation between their language performance and the level of cortical activation within the typical language areas. However, such a correlation was absent in the left TLE patients. After the ATL surgery, the left TLE patients showed reduced activation in the left MFG and right IFG, whereas no difference was observed in the right TLE patients. In the right TLE patients, the correlation between language performance and neural response shifted from the typical language areas to the anterior cingulate cortex.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the cortical language network is affected differently by the left and right temporal lobe epilepsy and is reorganized after anterior temporal lobectomy.},

  abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsy. Previous research has demonstrated several trends in human tissue that, undoubtedly, contribute to the development and progression of TLE. In this study we examined resected human hippocampus tissue for a variety of changes including gliosis that might contribute to the development and presentation of TLE. The study subjects consisted of six TLE patients and three sudden-death controls. Clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated by H\&amp;E staining. Immunohistological staining and Western blotting methods were used to analyze the samples. Neuronal hypertrophy was observed in resected epileptic tissue. Immunohistological staining demonstrated that activation of astrocytes was significantly increased in epileptic tissue as compared to corresponding regions of the control group. The Western blot data also showed increased CX43 and AQP4 in the hippocampus and downregulation of Kir4.1, $\alpha$-syntrophin, and dystrophin, the key constituents of AQP4 multi-molecular complex. These tissues also demonstrated changes in inflammatory factors (COX-2, TGF-$\beta$, NF-$\kappa$B) suggesting that these molecules may play an important role in TLE pathogenesis. In addition we detected increases in metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 2/3, mGluR5 and kainic acid receptor subunits KA1 (Grik4) and KA2 (Grik5) in patients' hippocampi. We noted increased expression of the $\alpha$1c subunit comprising class C L-type Ca2+ channels and calpain expression in these tissues, suggesting that these subunits might have an integral role in TLE pathogenesis. These changes found in the resected tissue suggest that they may contribute to TLE and that the kainic acid receptor (KAR) and deregulation of GluR2 receptor may play an important role in TLE development and disease course. This study identifies alterations in number of commonly studied molecular targets associated with astrogliosis, cellular hypertrophy, water homeostasis, inflammation, and modulation of excitatory neurotransmission in hippocampal tissues from TLE patients.},

Sixty-eight patients with non-MTS lesions (M:F = 42:26; age at onset: 11.7 $\pm$ 9.6 years; age at surgery: 21.1 $\pm$ 9.4 years), who underwent lesionectomy for refractory epilepsy were analyzed. The age at onset, frequency/type of seizure, MRI findings, video-EEG, histopathology and Engel's grading at 1 year/last follow up were recorded.
Results
The duration of epilepsy at surgery was 9.9 $\pm$ 6.9 years. The location of lesions were: temporal: 41 (60.3\%); frontal: 21 (30.9\%); parietal: 6 (8.8\%). The type of lesionectomies performed were temporal 41 (60.3\%), extra-temporal: 25 (36.8\%), temporo-frontal and temporo-parietal: 1 (1.5\%) patient each. The histopathological diagnosis were neoplastic: 32 (47.1\%), cortical dysplasia: 19 (27.9\%), other focal lesions: 17 (25\%). At mean follow up of 2.9 $\pm$ 2.1 years (median: 2.6 years), outcome was \textendash{} Engel's class I: 43 (63.2\%), IIa: 14 (20.6\%), III: 7 (10.3\%), IV: 4 (5.9\%). Good seizure control (Engel's class I/IIa) was achieved in 57 (83.8\%) patients. The good prognostic markers included temporal seizures, extended lesionectomy and AEDs after surgery while poor prognostic marker was gliotic lesion on histopathology.
Conclusion
Following lesionectomy due to non-MTS lesions, seizure freedom (Engel I) was noted in about 63.2\% of patients, which is comparable to other series and reiterates the effectiveness of lesionectomy for seizure control.},

Single-neuron electrophysiology is moving from the situation where a highly skilled experimentalist can patch a few cells per day, to a situation where robots will collect large amounts of data. To take advantage of this quantity of data, this technological advance requires a paradigm shift in the experimental design and analysis. Presently, most single-neuron experimental studies rely on old protocols\textemdash{}such as injections of steps and ramps of current\textemdash{}that rarely inform theoreticians and modelers interested in emergent properties of the brain. Here, we describe an efficient protocol for high-throughput in vitro electrophysiology as well as a set of mathematical tools that neuroscientists can use to directly translate experimental data into realistic spiking neuron models. The efficiency of the proposed method makes it suitable for high-throughput data analysis, allowing for the generation of a standardized database of realistic single-neuron models.},

  abstract = {Information can be encoded in the temporal patterning of spikes. How the brain reads these patterns is of general importance and represents one of the greatest challenges in neuroscience. We addressed this issue in relation to temporal pattern recognition in the anuran auditory system. Many species of anurans perform mating decisions based on the temporal structure of advertisement calls. One important temporal feature is the number of sound pulses that occur with a species-specific interpulse interval. Neurons representing this pulse count have been recorded in the anuran inferior colliculus, but the mechanisms underlying their temporal selectivity are incompletely understood. Here, we construct a parsimonious model that can explain the key dynamical features of these cells with biologically plausible elements. We demonstrate that interval counting arises naturally when combining interval-selective inhibition with pulse-per-pulse excitation having both fast- and slow-conductance synapses. Interval-dependent inhibition is modeled here by a simple architecture based on known physiology of afferent nuclei. Finally, we consider simple implementations of previously proposed mechanistic explanations for these counting neurons and show that they do not account for all experimental observations. Our results demonstrate that tens of millisecond-range temporal selectivities can arise from simple connectivity motifs of inhibitory neurons, without recourse to internal clocks, spike-frequency adaptation, or appreciable short-term plasticity.},

Using this reconstruction, we found a small-world topology with an average of 2.5 synapses separating any two cells and multiple cell-type-specific wiring features. Amounts of excitatory and inhibitory innervations varied across cells, yet pyramidal neurons maintained relatively constant excitation/inhibition ratios. The circuit contained highly connected hub neurons belonging to a small subset of cell types and forming an interconnected cell-type-specific rich club. Certain three-neuron motifs were overrepresented, matching recent experimental results. Cell-type-specific network properties were even more striking when synaptic strength and sign were considered in generating a functional topology. Our systematic approach enables interpretation of microconnectomics 'big data' and provides several experimentally testable predictions.},

Understanding how the brain represents, transforms and communicates information requires simultaneous recordings from distributed nodes of whole brain networks with single-cell resolution.

Chronic implantation of multi-electrode arrays allows long-term tracking of activity. Lithography on thin films provides a means to produce arrays of variable resolution, a high degree of flexibility, and minimal tissue displacement. Sequential application of surface arrays to monitor activity across brain-wide networks and subsequent implantation of laminar arrays to target specific populations enables continual refinement of spatial scale while maintaining coverage.},

  abstract = {This article presents, for the first time, a practical method for the direct quantification of frequency-specific synchronization (i.e., transient phase-locking) between two neuroelectric signals. The motivation for its development is to be able to examine the role of neural synchronies as a putative mechanism for long-range neural integration during cognitive tasks. The method, called phase-locking statistics (PLS), measures the significance of the phase covariance between two signals with a reasonable time-resolution ($<$100 ms). Unlike the more traditional method of spectral coherence, PLS separates the phase and amplitude components and can be directly interpreted in the framework of neural integration. To validate synchrony values against background fluctuations, PLS uses surrogate data and thus makes no a priori assumptions on the nature of the experimental data. We also apply PLS to investigate intracortical recordings from an epileptic patient performing a visual discrimination task. We find large-scale synchronies in the gamma band (45 Hz), e.g., between hippocampus and frontal gyrus, and local synchronies, within a limbic region, a few cm apart. We argue that whereas long-scale effects do reflect cognitive processing, short-scale synchronies are likely to be due to volume conduction. We discuss ways to separate such conduction effects from true signal synchrony. Hum Brain Mapping 8:194\textendash{}208, 1999. \textcopyright{} 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

One of their putative roles in the visual modality is feature-binding. We tested the stimulus specificity of high-frequency oscillations in humans using three types of visual stimuli: two coherent stimuli (a Kanizsa and a real triangle) and a noncoherent stimulus (``no-triangle stimulus''). The task of the subject was to count the occurrences of a curved illusory triangle. A time\textendash{}frequency analysis of single-trial EEG data recorded from eight human subjects was performed to characterize phase-locked as well as non-phase-locked high-frequency activities.
We found an early phase-locked 40 Hz component, maximal at electrodes Cz\textendash{}C4, which does not vary with stimulation type. We describe a second 40 Hz component, appearing around 280 msec, that is not phase-locked to stimulus onset. This component is stronger in response to a coherent triangle, whether real or illusory: it could reflect, therefore, a mechanism of feature binding based on high-frequency synchronization. Because both the illusory and the real triangle are more target-like, it could also correspond to an oscillatory mechanism for testing the match between stimulus and target. At the same latencies, the low-frequency evoked response components phase-locked to stimulus onset behave differently, suggesting that low- and high-frequency activities have different functional roles.},

The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used.

  abstract = {Neural dynamics preceding seizures are of interest because they may shed light on mechanisms of seizure generation and could be predictive. In healthy animals, hippocampal network activity is shaped by behavioral brain state and, in epilepsy, seizures selectively emerge during specific brain states. To determine the degree to which changes in network dynamics before seizure are pathological or reflect ongoing fluctuations in brain state, dorsal hippocampal neurons were recorded during spontaneous seizures in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Seizures emerged from all brain states, but with a greater likelihood after REM sleep, potentially due to an observed increase in baseline excitability during periods of REM compared with other brains states also characterized by sustained theta oscillations. When comparing the firing patterns of the same neurons across brain states associated with and without seizures, activity dynamics before seizures followed patterns typical of the ongoing brain state, or brain state transitions, and did not differ until the onset of the electrographic seizure. Next, we tested whether disparate activity patterns during distinct brain states would influence the effectiveness of optogenetic curtailment of hippocampal seizures in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Optogenetic curtailment was significantly more effective for seizures preceded by non-theta states compared with seizures that emerged from theta states. Our results indicate that consideration of behavioral brain state preceding a seizure is important for the appropriate interpretation of network dynamics leading up to a seizure and for designing effective seizure intervention.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Hippocampal single-unit activity is strongly shaped by behavioral brain state, yet this relationship has been largely ignored when studying activity dynamics before spontaneous seizures in medial temporal lobe epilepsy. In light of the increased attention on using single-unit activity for the prediction of seizure onset and closed-loop seizure intervention, we show a need for monitoring brain state to interpret correctly whether changes in neural activity before seizure onset is pathological or normal. Moreover, we also find that the brain state preceding a seizure determines the success of therapeutic interventions to curtail seizure duration. Together, these findings suggest that seizure prediction and intervention will be more successful if tailored for the specific brain states from which seizures emerge.},

Next, we tested whether disparate activity patterns during distinct brain states would influence the effectiveness of optogenetic curtailment of hippocampal seizures in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Optogenetic curtailment was significantly more effective for seizures preceded by non-theta states compared with seizures that emerged from theta states. Our results indicate that consideration of behavioral brain state preceding a seizure is important for the appropriate interpretation of network dynamics leading up to a seizure and for designing effective seizure intervention.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Hippocampal single-unit activity is strongly shaped by behavioral brain state, yet this relationship has been largely ignored when studying activity dynamics before spontaneous seizures in medial temporal lobe epilepsy. In light of the increased attention on using single-unit activity for the prediction of seizure onset and closed-loop seizure intervention, we show a need for monitoring brain state to interpret correctly whether changes in neural activity before seizure onset is pathological or normal. Moreover, we also find that the brain state preceding a seizure determines the success of therapeutic interventions to curtail seizure duration. Together, these findings suggest that seizure prediction and intervention will be more successful if tailored for the specific brain states from which seizures emerge.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that cross-frequency coupling (CFC) may serve a functional role in neuronal computation, communication, and learning. In particular, the strength of phase-amplitude CFC differs across brain areas in a task-relevant manner, changes quickly in response to sensory, motor, and cognitive events, and correlates with performance in learning tasks. Importantly, while high-frequency brain activity reflects local domains of cortical processing, low-frequency brain rhythms are dynamically entrained across distributed brain regions by both external sensory input and internal cognitive events. CFC may thus serve as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks operating at behavioral timescales to the fast, local cortical processing required for effective computation and synaptic modification, thus integrating functional systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales.},

  abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a ``high-input regime'' in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50\textendash{}100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10\textendash{}50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons\textemdash{}that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.},

  abstract = {The subject of neural coding has generated much debate. A key issue is whether the nervous system uses coarse or fine coding. Each has different strengths and weaknesses and, therefore, different implications for how the brain computes. For example, the strength of coarse coding is that it is robust to fluctuations in spike arrival times; downstream neurons do not have to keep track of the details of the spike train. The weakness, though, is that individual cells cannot carry much information, so downstream neurons have to pool signals across cells and/or time to obtain enough information to represent the sensory world and guide behavior. In contrast, with fine coding, individual cells can carry much more information, but downstream neurons have to resolve spike train structure to obtain it. Here, we set up a strategy to determine which codes are viable, and we apply it to the retina as a model system. We recorded from all the retinal output cells an animal uses to solve a task, evaluated the cells' spike trains for as long as the animal evaluates them, and used optimal, i.e., Bayesian, decoding. This approach makes it possible to obtain an upper bound on the performance of codes and thus eliminate those that are insufficient, that is, those that cannot account for behavioral performance. Our results show that standard coarse coding (spike count coding) is insufficient; finer, more information-rich codes are necessary.},

We show how to use information theory to validate simple stimulus-response models of neural coding of dynamic stimuli. Because these models require specification of spike timing precision, they can reveal which time scales contain information in neural coding. This approach shows that dynamic stimuli can be encoded efficiently by single neurons and that each spike contributes to information transmission.

This assumption has successfully described neural responses in many systems. The noise in rate coding neurons can be quantified by the coherence function or the correlation coefficient between the neuron's deterministic time-varying mean rate and noise corrupted single spike trains. Because of the finite data size, the mean rate cannot be known exactly and must be approximated. We introduce novel unbiased estimators for the measures of coherence and correlation which are based on the extrapolation of the signal to noise ratio in the neural response to infinite data size. We then describe the application of these estimates to the validation of the class of stimulus-response models that assume that the mean firing rate captures all the information embedded in the neural response. We explain how these quantifiers can be used to separate response prediction errors that are due to inaccurate model assumptions from errors due to noise inherent in neuronal spike trains.},

Recent attempts to obtain a generalized description of auditory cortical responses have often relied upon characterization of the spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF), which amounts to a model of the stimulus-response function (SRF) that is linear in the spectrogram of the stimulus. How well can such a model account for neural responses at the very first stages of auditory cortical processing? To answer this question, we develop a novel methodology for evaluating the fraction of stimulus-related response power in a population that can be captured by a given type of SRF model. We use this technique to show that, in the thalamo-recipient layers of primary auditory cortex, STRF models account for no more than 40\% of the stimulus-related power in neural responses.},

High background activity in neuronal recordings reduces the effectiveness of currently available burst detection methods. For long-term, stationary recordings, burst and background spikes have a bimodal ISI distribution which makes it easy to select the threshold to separate burst and background spikes. Finite, nonstationary recordings lead to noisy ISIs for which the bimodality is not that clear. We introduce a preprocessing method to separate burst from background spikes to improve burst detection reliability because it efficiently uses both single and multichannel activity. The method is tested using a stochastic model constrained by data available in the literature and recordings from primary cortical neurons cultured on multielectrode arrays. The separation between burst and background spikes is obtained using the interspike interval return map. The cutoff threshold is the key parameter to separate the burst and background spikes. We compare two methods for selecting the threshold. The 2-step method, in which threshold selection is based on fixed heuristics. The iterative method, in which the optimal cutoff threshold is directly estimated from the data. The proposed preprocessing method significantly increases the reliability of several established burst detection algorithms, both for simulated and real recordings.

  abstract = {The computational role of spike time synchronization at millisecond precision among neurons in the cerebral cortex is hotly debated. Studies performed on data of limited size provided experimental evidence that low-order correlations occur in relation to behavior. Advances in electrophysiological technology to record from hundreds of neurons simultaneously provide the opportunity to observe coordinated spiking activity of larger populations of cells. We recently published a method that combines data mining and statistical evaluation to search for significant patterns of synchronous spikes in massively parallel spike trains (Torre et al., 2013). The method solves the computational and multiple testing problems raised by the high dimensionality of the data. In the current study, we used our method on simultaneous recordings from two macaque monkeys engaged in an instructed-delay reach-to-grasp task to determine the emergence of spike synchronization in relation to behavior. We found a multitude of synchronous spike patterns aligned in both monkeys along a preferential mediolateral orientation in brain space. The occurrence of the patterns is highly specific to behavior, indicating that different behaviors are associated with the synchronization of different groups of neurons (``cell assemblies''). However, pooled patterns that overlap in neuronal composition exhibit no specificity, suggesting that exclusive cell assemblies become active during different behaviors, but can recruit partly identical neurons. These findings are consistent across multiple recording sessions analyzed across the two monkeys.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neurons in the brain communicate via electrical impulses called spikes. How spikes are coordinated to process information is still largely unknown. Synchronous spikes are effective in triggering a spike emission in receiving neurons and have been shown to occur in relation to behavior in a number of studies on simultaneous recordings of few neurons. We recently published a method to extend this type of investigation to larger data. Here, we apply it to simultaneous recordings of hundreds of neurons from the motor cortex of macaque monkeys performing a motor task. Our analysis reveals groups of neurons selectively synchronizing their activity in relation to behavior, which sheds new light on the role of synchrony in information processing in the cerebral cortex.},

  abstract = {Although the rhesus monkey is used widely as an animal model of human visual processing, it is not known whether invariant visual object recognition behavior is quantitatively comparable across monkeys and humans. To address this question, we systematically compared the core object recognition behavior of two monkeys with that of human subjects. To test true object recognition behavior (rather than image matching), we generated several thousand naturalistic synthetic images of 24 basic-level objects with high variation in viewing parameters and image background. Monkeys were trained to perform binary object recognition tasks on a match-to-sample paradigm. Data from 605 human subjects performing the same tasks on Mechanical Turk were aggregated to characterize ``pooled human'' object recognition behavior, as well as 33 separate Mechanical Turk subjects to characterize individual human subject behavior. Our results show that monkeys learn each new object in a few days, after which they not only match mean human performance but show a pattern of object confusion that is highly correlated with pooled human confusion patterns and is statistically indistinguishable from individual human subjects. Importantly, this shared human and monkey pattern of 3D object confusion is not shared with low-level visual representations (pixels, V1+; models of the retina and primary visual cortex) but is shared with a state-of-the-art computer vision feature representation. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that rhesus monkeys and humans share a common neural shape representation that directly supports object perception.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT To date, several mammalian species have shown promise as animal models for studying the neural mechanisms underlying high-level visual processing in humans. In light of this diversity, making tight comparisons between nonhuman and human primates is particularly critical in determining the best use of nonhuman primates to further the goal of the field of translating knowledge gained from animal models to humans. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first systematic attempt at comparing a high-level visual behavior of humans and macaque monkeys.},

  abstract = {The identification of important features in multi-electrode recordings requires the decomposition of data in order to disclose relevant features and to offer a clear graphical representation. This can be a demanding task. Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC; Hitchcock, 1927; Carrol and Chang, 1970; Harshman, 1970) is a method to decompose multi-dimensional arrays in order to focus on the features of interest, and provides a distinct illustration of the results. We applied PARAFAC to analyse spatio-temporal patterns in the functional connectivity between neurons, as revealed in their spike trains recorded in cat primary visual cortex (area 18). During these recordings we reversibly deactivated feedback connections from higher visual areas in the pMS (posterior middle suprasylvian) cortex in order to study the impact of these top-down signals. Cross correlation was computed for every possible pair of the 16 electrodes in the electrode array. PARAFAC was then used to reveal the effects of time, stimulus, and deactivation condition on the correlation patterns. Our results show that PARAFAC is able to reliably extract changes in correlation strength for different experimental conditions and display the relevant features. Thus, PARAFAC proves to be well-suited for the use in the context of electrophysiological (action potential) recordings.},

  abstract = {The cortex represents information across widely varying timescales. For instance, sensory cortex encodes stimuli that fluctuate over few tens of milliseconds, whereas in association cortex behavioural choices can require the maintenance of information over seconds. However, it remains poorly understood whether diverse timescales result mostly from features intrinsic to individual neurons or from neuronal population activity. This question remains unanswered, because the timescales of coding in populations of neurons have not been studied extensively, and population codes have not been compared systematically across cortical regions. Here we show that population codes can be essential to achieve long coding timescales. Furthermore, we find that the properties of population codes differ between sensory and association cortices. We compared coding for sensory stimuli and behavioural choices in auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex as mice performed a sound localization task. Auditory stimulus information was stronger in auditory cortex than in posterior parietal cortex, and both regions contained choice information. Although auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex coded information by tiling in time neurons that were transiently informative for approximately 200 milliseconds, the areas had major differences in functional coupling between neurons, measured as activity correlations that could not be explained by task events. Coupling among posterior parietal cortex neurons was strong and extended over long time lags, whereas coupling among auditory cortex neurons was weak and short-lived. Stronger coupling in posterior parietal cortex led to a population code with long timescales and a representation of choice that remained consistent for approximately 1 second. In contrast, auditory cortex had a code with rapid fluctuations in stimulus and choice information over hundreds of milliseconds. Our results reveal that population codes differ across cortex and that coupling is a variable property of cortical populations that affects the timescale of information coding and the accuracy of behaviour.},

  abstract = {During decision making, neurons in multiple brain regions exhibit responses that are correlated with decisions. However, it remains uncertain whether or not various forms of decision-related activity are causally related to decision making. Here we address this question by recording and reversibly inactivating the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas of rhesus macaques performing a motion direction discrimination task. Neurons in area LIP exhibited firing rate patterns that directly resembled the evidence accumulation process posited to govern decision making, with strong correlations between their response fluctuations and the animal's choices. Neurons in area MT, in contrast, exhibited weak correlations between their response fluctuations and choices, and had firing rate patterns consistent with their sensory role in motion encoding. The behavioural impact of pharmacological inactivation of each area was inversely related to their degree of decision-related activity: while inactivation of neurons in MT profoundly impaired psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP had no measurable impact on decision-making performance, despite having silenced the very clusters that exhibited strong decision-related activity. Although LIP inactivation did not impair psychophysical behaviour, it did influence spatial selection and oculomotor metrics in a free-choice control task. The absence of an effect on perceptual decision making was stable over trials and sessions and was robust to changes in stimulus type and task geometry, arguing against several forms of compensation. Thus, decision-related signals in LIP do not appear to be critical for computing perceptual decisions, and may instead reflect secondary processes. Our findings highlight a dissociation between decision correlation and causation, showing that strong neuron-decision correlations do not necessarily offer direct access to the neural computations underlying decisions.},

Nevertheless, theoretical studies on the coding accuracy inferred from the exact spike counting distributions are rare. We present an analysis based on the number of observed spikes assuming the stochastic perfect integrate-and-fire model with a change point, representing the stimulus onset, for which we calculate the corresponding Fisher information to investigate the accuracy of rate coding. We analyze the effect of changing the duration of the time window and the influence of several parameters of the model, in particular the level of the presynaptic spontaneous activity and the level of random fluctuation of the membrane potential, which can be interpreted as noise of the system. The results show that the Fisher information is nonmonotonic with respect to the length of the observation period. This counterintuitive result is caused by the discrete nature of the count of spikes. We observe also that the signal can be enhanced by noise, since the Fisher information is nonmonotonic with respect to the level of spontaneous activity and, in some cases, also with respect to the level of fluctuation of the membrane potential.},

However, how ensembles of neurons generate these events remains unclear. To address this question, in the present study, we investigated the network properties that might be required to a neuronal system for the generation of these spontaneous waves of spikes. We performed our study on spontaneously active neuronal cell cultures using high-resolution electrical recordings and a computational network model developed to reproduce our experimental data both quantitatively and qualitatively. Through the analysis of both experimental and simulated data, we found that network bursts are initiated in regions of the network, or ``functional communities'', characterized by particular local connectivity properties. We also found that these regions can amplify the background asynchronous spiking activity preceding a network burst and, in this way, can give rise to coordinated spiking events. As a whole, our results suggest the presence of functional communities of neurons in a developing neuronal system that might naturally emerge by following simple constraints on distance-based connectivity. These regions are most likely required for the generation of the spontaneous coordinated activity that can drive activity-dependent circuit formation.},

  volume = {5},
  issn = {1932-6157},
  abstract = {Neural spike trains, which are sequences of very brief jumps in voltage across the cell membrane, were one of the motivating applications for the development of point process methodology. Early work required the assumption of stationarity, but contemporary experiments often use time-varying stimuli and produce time-varying neural responses. More recently, many statistical methods have been developed for nonstationary neural point process data. There has also been much interest in identifying synchrony, meaning events across two or more neurons that are nearly simultaneous at the time scale of the recordings. A natural statistical approach is to discretize time, using short time bins, and to introduce loglinear models for dependency among neurons, but previous use of loglinear modeling technology has assumed stationarity. We introduce a succinct yet powerful class of time-varying loglinear models by (a) allowing individual-neuron effects (main effects) to involve time-varying intensities; (b) also allowing the individual-neuron effects to involve autocovariation effects (history effects) due to past spiking, (c) assuming excess synchrony effects (interaction effects) do not depend on history, and (d) assuming all effects vary smoothly across time. Using data from the primary visual cortex of an anesthetized monkey, we give two examples in which the rate of synchronous spiking cannot be explained by stimulusrelated changes in individual-neuron effects. In one example, the excess synchrony disappears when slow-wave "up" states are taken into account as history effects, while in the second example it does not. Standard point process theory explicitly rules out synchronous events. To justify our use of continuous-time methodology, we introduce a framework that incorporates synchronous events and provides continuous-time loglinear point process approximations to discrete-time loglinear models.},

Approximately one third of these connections are putative chemical synapses.

We estimated the model for a population of V1 neurons by analyzing the mean and covariance of the spatiotemporal distribution of random bar stimuli that were associated with spikes. This analysis reveals an unsuspected richness of neuronal computation within V1. Specifically, simple and complex cell responses are best described using more linear filters than the one or two found in standard models. Many filters revealed by the model contribute suppressive signals that appear to have a predominantly divisive influence on neuronal firing. Suppressive signals are especially potent in direction-selective cells, where they reduce responses to stimuli moving in the nonpreferred direction.},

We have in mind a model in which neurons are selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of a high dimensional stimulus space, but within this subspace the responses can be arbitrarily nonlinear. Existing analysis methods are based on correlation functions between stimuli and responses, but these methods are guaranteed to work only in the case of Gaussian stimulus ensembles. As an alternative to correlation functions, we maximize the mutual information between the neural responses and projections of the stimulus onto low dimensional subspaces. The procedure can be done iteratively by increasing the dimensionality of this subspace. Those dimensions that allow the recovery of all of the information between spikes and the full unprojected stimuli describe the relevant subspace. If the dimensionality of the relevant subspace indeed is small, it becomes feasible to map the neuron's input-output function even under fully natural stimulus conditions. These ideas are illustrated in simulations on model visual and auditory neurons responding to natural scenes and sounds, respectively.},

Determining the effects and relative importance of these factors is a challenging problem in neurophysiology. We propose a statistical framework based on the point process likelihood function to relate a neuron's spiking probability to three typical covariates: the neuron's own spiking history, concurrent ensemble activity, and extrinsic covariates such as stimuli or behavior. The framework uses parametric models of the conditional intensity function to define a neuron's spiking probability in terms of the covariates. The discrete time likelihood function for point processes is used to carry out model fitting and model analysis. We show that, by modeling the logarithm of the conditional intensity function as a linear combination of functions of the covariates, the discrete time point process likelihood function is readily analyzed in the generalized linear model (GLM) framework. We illustrate our approach for both GLM and non-GLM likelihood functions using simulated data and multivariate single-unit activity data simultaneously recorded from the motor cortex of a monkey performing a visuomotor pursuit-tracking task. The point process framework provides a flexible, computationally efficient approach for maximum likelihood estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment, residual analysis, model selection, and neural decoding. The framework thus allows for the formulation and analysis of point process models of neural spiking activity that readily capture the simultaneous effects of multiple covariates and enables the assessment of their relative importance.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004141},
  abstract = {Stimulus dimensionality-reduction methods in neuroscience seek to identify a low-dimensional space of stimulus features that affect a neuron's probability of spiking. One popular method, known as maximally informative dimensions (MID), uses an information-theoretic quantity known as ``single-spike information'' to identify this space. Here we examine MID from a model-based perspective. We show that MID is a maximum-likelihood estimator for the parameters of a linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model, and that the empirical single-spike information corresponds to the normalized log-likelihood under a Poisson model. This equivalence implies that MID does not necessarily find maximally informative stimulus dimensions when spiking is not well described as Poisson. We provide several examples to illustrate this shortcoming, and derive a lower bound on the information lost when spiking is Bernoulli in discrete time bins. To overcome this limitation, we introduce model-based dimensionality reduction methods for neurons with non-Poisson firing statistics, and show that they can be framed equivalently in likelihood-based or information-theoretic terms. Finally, we show how to overcome practical limitations on the number of stimulus dimensions that MID can estimate by constraining the form of the non-parametric nonlinearity in an LNP model. We illustrate these methods with simulations and data from primate visual cortex., A popular approach to the neural coding problem is to identify a low-dimensional linear projection of the stimulus space that preserves the aspects of the stimulus that affect a neuron's probability of spiking. Previous work has focused on both information-theoretic and likelihood-based estimators for finding such projections. Here, we show that these two approaches are in fact equivalent. We show that maximally informative dimensions (MID), a popular information-theoretic method for dimensionality reduction, is identical to the maximum-likelihood estimator for a particular linear-nonlinear encoding model with Poisson spiking. One implication of this equivalence is that MID may not find the information-theoretically optimal stimulus projection when spiking is non-Poisson, which we illustrate with a few simple examples. Using these insights, we propose novel dimensionality-reduction methods that incorporate non-Poisson spiking, and suggest new parametrizations that allow for tractable estimation of high-dimensional subspaces.},

  abstract = {A rigorous understanding of brain dynamics and function requires a conceptual bridge between multiple levels of organization, including neural spiking and network-level population activity. Mounting evidence suggests that neural networks of cerebral cortex operate at a critical regime, which is defined as a transition point between two phases of short lasting and chaotic activity. However, despite the fact that criticality brings about certain functional advantages for information processing, its supporting evidence is still far from conclusive, as it has been mostly based on power law scaling of size and durations of cascades of activity. Moreover, to what degree such hypothesis could explain some fundamental features of neural activity is still largely unknown. One of the most prevalent features of cortical activity in vivo is known to be spike irregularity of spike trains, which is measured in terms of the coefficient of variation (CV) larger than one. Here, using a minimal computational model of excitatory nodes, we show that irregular spiking (CV $>$ 1) naturally emerges in a recurrent network operating at criticality. More importantly, we show that even at the presence of other sources of spike irregularity, being at criticality maximizes the mean coefficient of variation of neurons, thereby maximizing their spike irregularity. Furthermore, we also show that such a maximized irregularity results in maximum correlation between neuronal firing rates and their corresponding spike irregularity (measured in terms of CV). On the one hand, using a model in the universality class of directed percolation, we propose new hallmarks of criticality at single-unit level, which could be applicable to any network of excitable nodes. On the other hand, given the controversy of the neural criticality hypothesis, we discuss the limitation of this approach to neural systems and to what degree they support the criticality hypothesis in real neural networks. Finally, we discuss the limitations of applying our results to real networks and to what degree they support the criticality hypothesis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In vivo neural recordings are often corrupted by different artifacts, especially in a less-constrained recording environment. Due to limited understanding of the artifacts appeared in the in vivo neural data, it is more challenging to identify artifacts from neural signal components compared with other applications. The objective of this work is to analyze artifact characteristics and to develop an algorithm for automatic artifact detection and removal without distorting the signals of interest.
NEW METHOD: The proposed algorithm for artifact detection and removal is based on the stationary wavelet transform with selected frequency bands of neural signals. The selection of frequency bands is based on the spectrum characteristics of in vivo neural data. Further, to make the proposed algorithm robust under different recording conditions, a modified universal-threshold value is proposed.
RESULTS: Extensive simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of both amount of artifact removal and amount of distortion to neural signals. The quantitative results reveal that the algorithm is quite robust for different artifact types and artifact-to-signal ratio.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Both real and synthesized data have been used for testing the proposed algorithm in comparison with other artifact removal algorithms (e.g., ICA, wICA, wCCA, EMD-ICA, and EMD-CCA) found in the literature. Comparative testing results suggest that the proposed algorithm performs better than the available algorithms.
CONCLUSION: Our work is expected to be useful for future research on in vivo neural signal processing and eventually to develop a real-time neural interface for advanced neuroscience and behavioral experiments.},

  abstract = {Large-scale neural activation dynamics in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit local field potential, observable as theta and gamma rhythms and coupling between these rhythms, is predictive of encoding success. Behavioral studies show that systemic administration of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists selectively impairs encoding, suggesting that they may also disrupt the coupling between the theta and gamma bands. Here, we tested the hypothesis that muscarinic antagonists selectively disrupt coupling between theta and gamma. Specifically, we characterized the effects of systemically administered scopolamine on movement-induced theta and gamma rhythms recorded in the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of freely moving rats. We report the novel result that gamma power at the peak of theta was most reduced following muscarinic blockade, significantly shifting the phase of maximal gamma power to occur at later phases of theta. We also characterize the existence of multiple distinct gamma bands in the superficial layers of the MEC. Further, we observed that theta frequency was significantly less modulated by movement speed following muscarinic blockade. Finally, the slope relating speed to theta frequency, a correlate of familiarity with a testing enclosure, increased significantly less between the preinjection and recovery trials when scopolamine was administered during the intervening injection session than when saline was administered, suggesting that scopolamine reduced encoding of the testing enclosure. These data are consistent with computational models suggesting that encoding and retrieval occur during the peak and trough of theta, respectively, and support the theory that acetylcholine regulates the balance between encoding versus retrieval.},

Importantly, APP knockout (APP-KO) mice exhibit cognitive deficits, suggesting that APP plays a role at the neuronal network level. To investigate this possibility, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the posterior parietal cortex, dorsal hippocampus and lateral prefrontal cortex of freely moving APP-KO mice. Spectral analyses showed that network oscillations within the theta- and gamma-frequency bands were not different between APP-KO and wild-type mice. Surprisingly, however, while gamma amplitude coupled to theta phase in all recorded regions of wild-type animals, in APP-KO mice theta-gamma coupling was strongly diminished in recordings from the parietal cortex and hippocampus, but not in LFPs recorded from the prefrontal cortex. Thus, lack of APP reduces oscillatory coupling in LFP recordings from specific brain regions, despite not affecting the amplitude of the oscillations. Together, our findings reveal reduced cross-frequency coupling as a functional marker of APP deficiency at the network level.},

Local field potentials (LFPs) reflect dendritic and synaptic oscillations whose temporal structure may coordinate cellular mechanisms of plasticity and memory. We now report that single-trial spatial memory performance in rats was predicted by the power comodulation of theta (4-10 Hz) and low gamma (30-50 Hz) rhythms in the hippocampus. Theta-gamma comodulation (TGC) was prominent during successful memory retrieval but was weak when memory failed or was unavailable during spatial exploration in sample trials. Muscimol infusion into medial septum reduced the probability of TGC and successful memory retrieval. In contrast, patterned electrical stimulation of the fimbria-fornix increased TGC in amnestic animals and partially rescued memory performance in the water maze. The results suggest that TGC accompanies memory retrieval in the hippocampus and that patterned brain stimulation may inform therapeutic strategies for cognitive disorders.},

  abstract = {One of the outstanding problems in the sorting of neuronal spike trains is the resolution of overlapping spikes. Resolving these spikes can significantly improve a range of analyses, such as response variability, correlation, and latency. In this paper, we describe a partially automated method that is capable of resolving overlapping spikes. After constructing template waveforms for well-isolated and distinct single units, we generated pair-wise combinations of those templates at all possible time shifts from each other. Subsequently, overlapping waveforms were identified by cluster analysis, and then assigned to their respective single-unit combinations. We examined the performance of this method using simulated data from an earlier study, and found that we were able to resolve an average of 83\% of the overlapping waveforms across various signal-to-noise ratios, an improvement of approximately 32\% over the results reported in the earlier study. When applied to additional simulated data sets generated from single-electrode and tetrode recordings, we were able to resolve 91\% of the overlapping waveforms with a false positive rate of 0.19\% for single-electrode data, and 95\% of the overlapping waveforms with a false positive rate of 0.27\% for tetrode data. We also applied our method to electrode and tetrode data recorded from the primary visual cortex, and the results obtained for these datasets suggest that our method provides an efficient means of sorting overlapping waveforms. This method can easily be added as an extra step to commonly used spike sorting methods, such as KlustaKwik and MClust software packages, and can be applied to datasets that have already been sorted using these methods.},

  abstract = {Microcircuits are composed of multiple cell classes that likely serve unique circuit operations. But how cell classes map onto circuit functions is largely unknown, particularly for primate prefrontal cortex during actual goal-directed behavior. One difficulty in this quest is to reliably distinguish cell classes in extracellular recordings of action potentials. Here we surmount this issue and report that spike shape and neural firing variability provide reliable markers to segregate seven functional classes of prefrontal cells in macaques engaged in an attention task. We delineate an unbiased clustering protocol that identifies four broad spiking (BS) putative pyramidal cell classes and three narrow spiking (NS) putative inhibitory cell classes dissociated by how sparse, bursty, or regular they fire. We speculate that these functional classes map onto canonical circuit functions. First, two BS classes show sparse, bursty firing, and phase synchronize their spiking to 3\textendash{}7 Hz (theta) and 12\textendash{}20 Hz (beta) frequency bands of the local field potential (LFP). These properties make cells flexibly responsive to network activation at varying frequencies. Second, one NS and two BS cell classes show regular firing and higher rate with only marginal synchronization preference. These properties are akin to setting tonically the excitation and inhibition balance. Finally, two NS classes fired irregularly and synchronized to either theta or beta LFP fluctuations, tuning them potentially to frequency-specific subnetworks. These results suggest that a limited set of functional cell classes emerges in macaque prefrontal cortex (PFC) during attentional engagement to not only represent information, but to subserve basic circuit operations.},

The prevailing assumption is that surface potentials primarily reflect synaptic activity, although non-synaptic events may also contribute. Here we show that dendritic calcium spikes occurring in pyramidal neurons (that we showed previously are cognitively relevant) are clearly detectable in cortical surface potentials. To show this we developed an optogenetic, non-synaptic approach to evoke dendritic calcium spikes in vivo. We found that optogenetically evoked calcium spikes were easily detectable and had an unexpected waveform near the cortical surface. Sensory-evoked dendritic calcium spikes were also clearly detectable with amplitudes that matched the contribution of synaptic input. These results reveal how dendritic calcium spikes appear at the cortical surface and their significant impact on surface potentials, suggesting that long-standing surface recording data may contain information about dendritic activity that is relevant to behavior and cognitive function. Surface EEG recordings are thought to primarily detect synaptic activity. Here the authors devise an optogenetic method to evoke dendritic calcium spikes in layer 5 pyramidal cells of the rat somatosensory cortex, and report that optogenetically evoked, as well as sensory-evoked dendritic calcium spikes make a significant contribution to surface EEG recordings.},

We are able to identify the contributions of individual presynaptic neurons - including inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs - to postsynaptic potentials, which enables us to study dendritic integration. Since the electrical stimuli can be controlled at microsecond resolution, our method enables to evoke action potentials at tens of presynaptic cells in precisely orchestrated sequences of high reliability and minimum jitter.

  abstract = {Electrophysiology is entering the era of 'Big Data'. Multiple probes, each with hundreds to thousands of individual electrodes, are now capable of simultaneously recording from many brain regions. The major challenge confronting these new technologies is transforming the raw data into physiologically meaningful signals, i.e. single unit spikes. Sorting the spike events of individual neurons from a spatiotemporally dense sampling of the extracellular electric field is a problem that has attracted much attention (Rey 2015, Rossant 2016), but is still far from solved. Current methods still rely on human input and thus become unfeasible as the size of the data sets grow exponentially. Here we introduce the t-student stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne) dimensionality reduction method (Van der Maaten 2008) as a visualization tool in the spike sorting process. T-sne embeds the n-dimensional extracellular spikes (n = number of features by which each spike is decomposed) into a low (usually two) dimensional space. We show that such embeddings, even starting from different feature spaces, form obvious clusters of spikes that can be easily visualized and manually delineated with a high degree of precision. We propose that these clusters represent single units and test this assertion by applying our algorithm on labeled data sets both from hybrid (Rossant 2016) and paired juxtacellular/extracellular recordings (Neto 2016). We have released a graphical user interface (gui) written in python as a tool for the manual clustering of the t-sne embedded spikes and as a tool for an informed overview and fast manual curation of results from other clustering algorithms. Furthermore, the generated visualizations offer evidence in favor of the use of probes with higher density and smaller electrodes. They also graphically demonstrate the diverse nature of the sorting problem when spikes are recorded with different methods and arise from regions with different background spiking statistics.},

To explore this possibility, we analyzed local field potential oscillations recorded simultaneously from the striatum and the hippocampus. As rats performed a task requiring active navigation and decision making, the amplitudes of multiple high-frequency oscillations were dynamically modulated in task-dependent patterns by the phase of cooccurring theta-band oscillations both within and across these structures, particularly during decision-making behavioral epochs. Moreover, the modulation patterns uncovered distinctions among both high- and low-frequency subbands.

Using 3D reconstructions of 298 neocortical cells of different types (including nest basket, small basket, large basket, bitufted, pyramidal, and Martinotti cells), we constructed a structural model of a cortical microcircuit, in which cells of different types were independently and randomly placed. We compared the positions of physical appositions resulting from the incidental overlap of axonal and dendritic arbors in the model (statistical structural connectivity) with the positions of putative functional synapses (functional synaptic connectivity) in 90 synaptic connections reconstructed from cortical slice preparations. Overall, we found that statistical connectivity predicted an average of 74 $\pm$ 2.7\% (mean $\pm$ SEM) synapse location distributions for nine types of cortical connections. This finding suggests that chemospecific attractive and repulsive mechanisms generally do not result in pairwise-specific connectivity. In some cases, however, the predicted distributions do not match precisely, indicating that chemospecific steering and aligning of the arbors may occur for some types of connections. This finding suggests that random alignment of axonal and dendritic arbors provides a sufficient foundation for specific functional connectivity to emerge in local neural microcircuits.},

Brain activity generates extracellular voltage fluctuations recorded as local field potentials (LFPs). It is known that the relevant microvariables, the ionic currents across membranes, jointly generate the macrovariables, the extracellular voltage, but neither the detailed biophysical knowledge nor the required computational power have been available to model these processes. We simulated the LFP in a model of the rodent neocortical column composed of $>$12,000 reconstructed, multicompartmental, and spiking cortical layer 4 and 5 pyramidal neurons and basket cells, including five million dendritic and somatic compartments with voltage- and ion-dependent currents, realistic connectivity, and probabilistic AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. We found that, depending on a number of factors, the LFP reflects local and cross-layer processing. Active currents dominate the generation of LFPs, not synaptic ones. Spike-related currents impact the LFP not only at higher frequencies but below 50~Hz. This work calls for re-evaluating the genesis of LFPs.},

Although plasticity in corticostriatal circuits has been implicated in learning physical skills, it remains unclear if similar circuits or processes are required for abstract skill learning. Here we use a novel behavioural task in rodents to investigate the role of corticostriatal plasticity in abstract skill learning. Rodents learned to control the pitch of an auditory cursor to reach one of two targets by modulating activity in primary motor cortex irrespective of physical movement. Degradation of the relation between action and outcome, as well as sensory-specific devaluation and omission tests, demonstrate that these learned neuroprosthetic actions are intentional and goal-directed, rather than habitual. Striatal neurons change their activity with learning, with more neurons modulating their activity in relation to target-reaching as learning progresses. Concomitantly, strong relations between the activity of neurons in motor cortex and the striatum emerge. Specific deletion of striatal NMDA receptors impairs the development of this corticostriatal plasticity, and disrupts the ability to learn neuroprosthetic skills. These results suggest that corticostriatal plasticity is necessary for abstract skill learning, and that neuroprosthetic movements capitalize on the neural circuitry involved in natural motor learning.},

It has been postulated that selective temporal coordination between neurons and development of functional neuronal assemblies are fundamental for brain function and behavior. Still, there is little evidence that functionally relevant coordination emerges preferentially in neuronal assemblies directly controlling behavioral output. We investigated coherence between primary motor cortex and the dorsal striatum as rats learn an abstract operant task. Striking coherence developed between these regions during learning. Interestingly, coherence was selectively increased in cells controlling behavioral output relative to adjacent cells. Furthermore, the temporal offset of these interactions aligned closely with corticostriatal conduction delays, demonstrating highly precise timing. Spikes from either region were followed by a consistent phase in the other, suggesting that network feedback reinforces coherence. Together, these results demonstrate that temporally precise coherence develops during learning specifically in output-relevant neuronal populations and further suggest that correlations in oscillatory activity serve to synchronize widespread brain networks to produce behavior.},

The concept of a neural tuning curve \textendash{} the mapping from input variables such as movement direction to output firing rate \textendash{} has proven useful in investigating neural function. However, prior work shows that tuning curves are not fixed but may be remapped as a function of task demands \textendash{} presumably via high-level mechanisms of cognitive control. How is this accomplished? Brain rhythms may play a causal role in this process, but the coupling of single cells to network activity remains poorly understood. We investigated the coupling between rhythmic beta activity and spiking as macaques performed two different tasks. This coupling can be described in terms of a function that maps oscillatory amplitude and phase to instantaneous spike rate. Similarly to direction tuning, this ``internal'' tuning curve also exhibits task-dependent changes. We characterize these changes across a large ensemble of simultaneously-recorded cells, and consider some of the neuro-computational implications presented by cross-level coupling between single cells and large-scale networks. In particular, relative to the slow time-scale of behavior, the observed beta-to-rate mappings may prove useful for modulating winner-take-all dynamics on intermediate time-scales and relative spike timing on fast time-scales.},

  abstract = {Oscillatory phase coupling within large-scale brain networks is a topic of increasing interest within systems, cognitive, and theoretical neuroscience. Evidence shows that brain rhythms play a role in controlling neuronal excitability and response modulation (Haider B, McCormick D. Neuron 62: 171\textendash{}189, 2009) and regulate the efficacy of communication between cortical regions (Fries P. Trends Cogn Sci 9: 474\textendash{}480, 2005) and distinct spatiotemporal scales (Canolty RT, Knight RT. Trends Cogn Sci 14: 506\textendash{}515, 2010). In this view, anatomically connected brain areas form the scaffolding upon which neuronal oscillations rapidly create and dissolve transient functional networks (Lakatos P, Karmos G, Mehta A, Ulbert I, Schroeder C. Science 320: 110\textendash{}113, 2008). Importantly, testing these hypotheses requires methods designed to accurately reflect dynamic changes in multivariate phase coupling within brain networks. Unfortunately, phase coupling between neurophysiological signals is commonly investigated using suboptimal techniques. Here we describe how a recently developed probabilistic model, phase coupling estimation (PCE; Cadieu C, Koepsell K Neural Comput 44: 3107\textendash{}3126, 2010), can be used to investigate changes in multivariate phase coupling, and we detail the advantages of this model over the commonly employed phase-locking value (PLV; Lachaux JP, Rodriguez E, Martinerie J, Varela F. Human Brain Map 8: 194\textendash{}208, 1999). We show that the N-dimensional PCE is a natural generalization of the inherently bivariate PLV. Using simulations, we show that PCE accurately captures both direct and indirect (network mediated) coupling between network elements in situations where PLV produces erroneous results. We present empirical results on recordings from humans and nonhuman primates and show that the PCE-estimated coupling values are different from those using the bivariate PLV. Critically on these empirical recordings, PCE output tends to be sparser than the PLVs, indicating fewer significant interactions and perhaps a more parsimonious description of the data. Finally, the physical interpretation of PCE parameters is straightforward: the PCE parameters correspond to interaction terms in a network of coupled oscillators. Forward modeling of a network of coupled oscillators with parameters estimated by PCE generates synthetic data with statistical characteristics identical to empirical signals. Given these advantages over the PLV, PCE is a useful tool for investigating multivariate phase coupling in distributed brain networks.},

  abstract = {The cerebral cortex is subdivided into 6 layers based on morphological features. The supragranular layers 2/3 (L2/3) contain morphologically and genetically diverse populations of neurons, suggesting the existence of discrete classes of cells. In primates and carnivores L2/3 can be subdivided morphologically, but cytoarchitectonic divisions are less clear in rodents. Nevertheless, discrete classes of cells could exist based on their computational requirement, which might be linked to their associated functional microcircuits. Through in vitro slice recordings coupled with laser scanning photostimulation we investigated if L2/3 of male mouse auditory cortex contains discrete subpopulations of cells with specific functional microcircuits. We use hierarchical clustering on the laminar connection patterns to reveal the existence of multiple distinct classes of L2/3 neurons. The classes of L2/3 neurons are distinguished by the pattern of their laminar and columnar inputs from within A1 and their location within L2/3. Cells in superficial L2 show more extensive columnar integration than deeper L3 cells. Moreover, L3 cells receive more translaminar input from L4. In vivo imaging in awake mice revealed that L2 cells had higher bandwidth than L3 cells \textemdash{} consistent with the laminar differences in columnar integration. These results suggest that similar to higher mammals, rodent L2/3 is not a homogenous layer but contains several parallel microcircuits.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Layer 2/3 of auditory cortex is functionally diverse. We investigated whether L2/3 cells form classes based on their functional connectivity. We used in vitro whole cell patch-clamp recordings with laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) and performed unsupervised clustering on the resulting excitatory and inhibitory connection patterns. Cells within each class were located in different sublaminae. Superficial cells showed wider integration along the tonotopic axis and the amount of L4 input varied with sublaminar location. To identify if sensory responses varied with sublaminar location, we performed in vivo Ca2+-imaging and found that L2 cells were less frequency selective than L3 cells. Our results show that the diversity of receptive fields in L2/3 is likely due to diversity in the underlying functional circuits.},

We demonstrate how Spike train SIMilarity Space (SSIMS) analysis captures the relationship between goal directions for an 8-directional reaching task and successfully segregates grasp types in a 3D grasping task in the absence of kinematic information. The algorithm enables exploration of virtually any type of neural spiking (time series) data, providing similarity-based clustering of neural activity states with minimal assumptions about potential information encoding models.},

Recent findings from the human neocortex show that the power of fast gamma oscillations (30\textendash{}150 Hz) is modulated by the phase of slower theta oscillations (5\textendash{}8 Hz).

Furthermore, different behavioral tasks evoke distinct patterns of theta/high gamma coupling across the cortex. The results indicate that transient coupling between low- and high-frequency brain rhythms coordinates activity in distributed cortical areas, providing a mechanism for effective communication during cognitive processing in humans.},

This paper compares three published methods for detecting nested oscillation and a fourth method proposed in this paper. These are: (i) the modulation index, (ii) the phase-locking value (PLV), (iii) the envelope-to-signal correlation (ESC) and (iv) a general linear model (GLM) measure derived from ESC. We applied the methods to electrocorticographic (ECoG) data recorded during a working-memory task and to data from a simulated hippocampal interneuron network. Further simulations were then made to address the dependence of each measure on signal to noise level, coupling phase, epoch length, sample rate, signal nonstationarity, and multi-phasic coupling. Our overall conclusion is that the GLM measure is the best all-round approach for detecting nested oscillation.},

  abstract = {Seizures can occur spontaneously and in a recurrent manner, which defines epilepsy; or they can be induced in a normal brain under a variety of conditions in most neuronal networks and species from flies to humans. Such universality raises the possibility that invariant properties exist that characterize seizures under different physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we analysed seizure dynamics mathematically and established a taxonomy of seizures based on first principles. For the predominant seizure class we developed a generic model called Epileptor. As an experimental model system, we used ictal-like discharges induced in vitro in mouse hippocampi. We show that only five state variables linked by integral-differential equations are sufficient to describe the onset, time course and offset of ictal-like discharges as well as their recurrence. Two state variables are responsible for generating rapid discharges (fast time scale), two for spike and wave events (intermediate time scale) and one for the control of time course, including the alternation between 'normal' and ictal periods (slow time scale). We propose that normal and ictal activities coexist: a separatrix acts as a barrier (or seizure threshold) between these states. Seizure onset is reached upon the collision of normal brain trajectories with the separatrix. We show theoretically and experimentally how a system can be pushed toward seizure under a wide variety of conditions. Within our experimental model, the onset and offset of ictal-like discharges are well-defined mathematical events: a saddle-node and homoclinic bifurcation, respectively. These bifurcations necessitate a baseline shift at onset and a logarithmic scaling of interspike intervals at offset. These predictions were not only confirmed in our in vitro experiments, but also for focal seizures recorded in different syndromes, brain regions and species (humans and zebrafish). Finally, we identified several possible biophysical parameters contributing to the five state variables in our model system. We show that these parameters apply to specific experimental conditions and propose that there exists a wide array of possible biophysical mechanisms for seizure genesis, while preserving central invariant properties. Epileptor and the seizure taxonomy will guide future modeling and translational research by identifying universal rules governing the initiation and termination of seizures and predicting the conditions necessary for those transitions.},

  abstract = {Studying neocortex and hippocampus in parallel, we are struck by the similarities. All three to four layered allocortices and the six layered mammalian neocortex arise in the pallium. All receive and integrate multiple cortical and subcortical inputs, provide multiple outputs and include an array of neuronal classes. During development, each cell positions itself to sample appropriate local and distant inputs and to innervate appropriate targets. Simpler cortices had already solved the need to transform multiple coincident inputs into serviceable outputs before neocortex appeared in mammals. Why then do phylogenetically more recent cortices need multiple pyramidal cell layers? A simple answer is that more neurones can compute more complex functions. The dentate gyrus and hippocampal CA regions - which might be seen as hippocampal antecedents of neocortical layers - lie side by side, albeit around a tight bend. Were the millions of cells of rat neocortex arranged in like fashion, the surface area of the CA pyramidal cell layers would be some forty times larger. Even if evolution had managed to fold this immense sheet into the space available, the distances between neurones that needed to be synaptically connected would be huge and to maintain the speed of information transfer, massive, myelinated fibre tracts would be needed. How much more practical to stack the `cells that fire and wire together' into narrow columns, while retaining the mechanisms underlying the extraordinary precision with which circuits form. This demonstrably efficient arrangement presents us with challenges, however, not the least being to categorise the baffling array of neuronal subtypes in each of five `pyramidal layers'. If we imagine the puzzle posed by this bewildering jumble of apical dendrites, basal dendrites and axons, from many different pyramidal and interneuronal classes, that is encountered by a late-arriving interneurone insinuating itself into a functional circuit, we can perhaps begin to understand why definitive classification is such a challenge. Here, we summarize and compare the development of these two cortices, the properties of their neurones, the circuits they form and the ordered, unidirectional flow of information from one hippocampal region, or one neocortical layer, to another.},

  abstract = {A central tenet in support of research reproducibility is the ability to uniquely identify research resources, i.e., reagents, tools, and materials that are used to perform experiments. However, current reporting practices for research resources are insufficient to identify the exact resources that are reported or to answer basic questions such as ``How did other studies use resource X?'' To address this issue, the Resource Identification Initiative was launched as a pilot project to improve the reporting standards for research resources in the Methods sections of articles and thereby improve identifiability and scientific reproducibility. The pilot engaged over 25 biomedical journal editors from most major publishers, as well as scientists and funding officials. Authors were asked to include Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) in their articles prior to publication for three resource types: antibodies, model organisms, and tools (i.e., software and databases). RRIDs are assigned by an authoritative database, for example, a model organism database for each type of resource. To make it easier for authors to obtain RRIDs, resources were aggregated from the appropriate databases and their RRIDs made available in a central Web portal (http://scicrunch.org/resources). RRIDs meet three key criteria: they are machine-readable, free to generate and access, and are consistent across publishers and journals. The pilot was launched in February of 2014 and over 300 articles have appeared that report RRIDs. The number of journals participating has expanded from the original 25 to more than 40, with RRIDs appearing in 62 different journals to date. Here we present an overview of the pilot project and its outcomes to date. We show that authors are able to identify resources and are supportive of the goals of the project. Identifiability of the resources post-pilot showed a dramatic improvement for all three resource types, suggesting that the project has had a significant impact on identifiability of research resources.

  abstract = {The use of chronic intracortical multielectrode arrays has become increasingly prevalent in neurophysiological experiments. However, it is not obvious whether neuronal signals obtained over multiple recording sessions come from the same or different neurons. Here, we develop a criterion to assess single-unit stability by measuring the similarity of 1) average spike waveforms and 2) interspike interval histograms (ISIHs). Neuronal activity was recorded from four Utah arrays implanted in primary motor and premotor cortices in three rhesus macaque monkeys during 10 recording sessions over a 15- to 17-day period. A unit was defined as stable through a given day if the stability criterion was satisfied on all recordings leading up to that day. We found that 57\% of the original units were stable through 7 days, 43\% were stable through 10 days, and 39\% were stable through 15 days. Moreover, stable units were more likely to remain stable in subsequent recording sessions (i.e., 89\% of the neurons that were stable through four sessions remained stable on the fifth). Using both waveform and ISIH data instead of just waveforms improved performance by reducing the number of false positives. We also demonstrate that this method can be used to track neurons across days, even during adaptation to a visuomotor rotation. Identifying a stable subset of neurons should allow the study of long-term learning effects across days and has practical implications for pooling of behavioral data across days and for increasing the effectiveness of brain\textendash{}machine interfaces.},

However, the presence of critical states in the awake brain remains controversial. Here, we compared avalanche analyses performed on different in vivo preparations during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep, and REM sleep, using high density electrode arrays in cat motor cortex (96 electrodes), monkey motor cortex and premotor cortex and human temporal cortex (96 electrodes) in epileptic patients. In neuronal avalanches defined from units (up to 160 single units), the size of avalanches never clearly scaled as power-law, but rather scaled exponentially or displayed intermediate scaling. We also analyzed the dynamics of local field potentials (LFPs) and in particular LFP negative peaks (nLFPs) among the different electrodes (up to 96 sites in temporal cortex or up to 128 sites in adjacent motor and premotor cortices). In this case, the avalanches defined from nLFPs displayed power-law scaling in double logarithmic representations, as reported previously in monkey. However, avalanche defined as positive LFP (pLFP) peaks, which are less directly related to neuronal firing, also displayed apparent power-law scaling. Closer examination of this scaling using the more reliable cumulative distribution function (CDF) and other rigorous statistical measures, did not confirm power-law scaling. The same pattern was seen for cats, monkey, and human, as well as for different brain states of wakefulness and sleep. We also tested other alternative distributions. Multiple exponential fitting yielded optimal fits of the avalanche dynamics with bi-exponential distributions. Collectively, these results show no clear evidence for power-law scaling or self-organized critical states in the awake and sleeping brain of mammals, from cat to man.},

Here we report the first examination of spike train patterns in large ensembles of single neurons during seizures in persons with epilepsy. Contrary to the traditional view, neuronal spiking activity during seizure initiation and spread was highly heterogeneous, not hypersynchronous, suggesting complex interactions among different neuronal groups even at the spatial scale of small cortical patches. In contrast to earlier stages, seizure termination is a nearly homogenous phenomenon followed by an almost complete cessation of spiking across recorded neuronal ensembles. Notably, even neurons outside the region of seizure onset showed significant changes in activity minutes before the seizure. These findings suggest a revision of current thinking about seizure mechanisms and point to the possibility of seizure prevention based on spiking activity in neocortical neurons.},

A widely held view is that declarative memories are initially encoded in the hippocampus, then transferred to the neocortex for long-term storage. Alternate views argue instead that the hippocampus continues to play a role in remote memory recall. These competing theories are largely based on human amnesic and animal lesion/inactivation studies. However, in vivo electrophysiological evidence supporting these views is scarce. Given that other studies examining the role of the hippocampus in remote memory retrieval using lesion and imaging techniques in human and animal models have provided mixed results, it would be particularly useful to gain insight at the in vivo electrophysiological level. Here we report hippocampal single-neuron and theta activity recorded longitudinally during acquisition and remote retrieval of trace eyeblink conditioning. Results from conditioned rabbits were compared to those obtained from yoked pseudo-conditioned control rabbits. Results reveal continued learning-specific hippocampal activity one month after initial acquisition of the task. Our findings yield insight into the normal physiological responses of the hippocampus during memory processes and provide compelling in vivo electrophysiological evidence that the hippocampus is involved in both acquisition and retrieval of consolidated memories. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The problem of comparing two different partitions of a finite set of objects reappears continually in the clustering literature. We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Miligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between $\pm$1.},

This article examines the intimate relationship that exists between Dunn's index, single linkage clustering, and a visual method called iVAT for estimating the number of clusters in the input data. The relationship of Dunn's index to iVAT and single linkage in the labeled data case affords a means to better understand the utility of these three companion methods when data are crisply clustered in the unlabeled case (the real case). Numerical examples using simulated waveform data drawn from the field of neuroscience illustrate the natural compatibility of Dunn's index with iVAT and single linkage. A second aim of this note is to study customizing the three methods by changing the distance measure from Euclidean distance to one that may be more appropriate for assessing the validity of crisp clusters of finite sets of waveform data. We present numerical examples that support our assertion that when used collectively, the three methods afford a useful approach to evaluation of crisp clusters in unlabeled waveform data.},

Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

Using this intrinsic heterogeneity, diverse populations were able to code for twofold more information than their homogeneous counterparts. In addition, biophysical variability alone reduced pair-wise output spike correlations to low levels. Our results indicate that intrinsic neuronal diversity is important for neural coding and is not simply the result of biological imprecision.},

The subsequent pattern formation of functional networks is constrained by the structural connectivity (SC) of the brain. The extent to which information is processed over short- or long-range SC is unclear. Whole-brain models based on long-range axonal connections, for example, can partly describe measured functional connectivity dynamics at rest. Here, we study the effect of SC on the network response to stimulation. We use a human whole-brain network model comprising long- and short-range connections. We systematically activate each cortical or thalamic area, and investigate the network response as a function of its short- and long-range SC. We show that when the brain is operating at the edge of criticality, stimulation causes a cascade of network recruitments, collapsing onto a smaller space that is partly constrained by SC. We found both short- and long-range SC essential to reproduce experimental results. In particular, the stimulation of specific areas results in the activation of one or more resting-state networks. We suggest that the stimulus-induced brain activity, which may indicate information and cognitive processing, follows specific routes imposed by structural networks explaining the emergence of functional networks. We provide a lookup table linking stimulation targets and functional network activations, which potentially can be useful in diagnostics and treatments with brain stimulation.},

The presence of clusters can be detected easily through the direct observation of a dark blocks structure along the main diagonal of the intensity image. Alternatively, if the Dunn's index for a single linkage partition is greater than 1, then it is a good indication of the blocklike structure. In this report, the Dunn's index is applied as a novel measure of tendency on 8 pharmacological data sets, represented by machine-learning-selected molecular descriptors. In all cases, observed values are less than 1, thus indicating a weak tendency for data to form compact clusters.

To investigate the activity of individual neurons and discriminate spikes generated by different neurons a technique called spike sorting can be applied on the recorded data. However, the performance of current spike sorting methods is challenged by multichannel neural data recorded with high-density, highchannel count silicon probes developed recently. Our group started to develop an FPGA-based solution to accelerate the clustering of spikes detected in high-channel count neural recordings. It is a crucial step of the development to validate the performance of the clustering algorithm. This can be achieved by using ground truth datasets where the exact time of spikes fired by different single units are known. In this paper we present an FPGA-based architecture for real-time generation of multichannel hybrid ground truth datasets, which will be used for the validation of our FPGA-based clustering algorithm.},

We used paired recordings and quantitative morphological analysis to reveal distinct synaptic transmission properties, connection patterns, and morphological differentiation correlated with heterogeneous thalamic input to two different groups of pyramidal cells residing in layer 5 (L5) of rat frontal cortex. Retrograde tracers were used to label two projection subtypes in L5: crossed-corticostriatal (CCS) cells projecting to both sides of the striatum, and corticopontine (CPn) cells projecting to the ipsilateral pons. Although CPn/CPn and CCS/CCS pairs had similar connection probabilities, CPn/CPn pairs exhibited greater reciprocal connectivity, stronger unitary synaptic transmission, and more facilitation of paired-pulse responses. These synaptic characteristics were strongly correlated to the projection subtype of the presynaptic neuron. CPn and CCS cells were further differentiated according to their somatic position (L5a and L5b, the latter denser thalamic afferent fibers) and their dendritic/axonal arborizations. Together, our data demonstrate that the pyramidal projection system is segregated into different output channels according to subcortical target and thalamic input, and that information flow within and between these channels is selectively organized.},

We classified layer V (L5) pyramidal cells in rat frontal cortex into three physiological subtypes based on the presence (SA-d type) or absence (SA type) of an initial burst in neurons displaying slowly adapting spike trains, or fast spike frequency adaptation (FA type) against current pulse injections. Pyramidal cells projecting to the particular subcortical areas were correlated with the physiological subtypes. Focal glutamate stimulation of a L2/3 pyramidal cell induced EPSCs in SA and SA-d cells more frequently than in FA cells. FA cells in upper L5 received more inputs from the upper L2/3, and those in lower L5 received inputs from cells in lower L2/3, suggesting topographic interlaminar projections to FA cells. Dual recordings from L5 pyramidal cells revealed that common input probability that two L5 cells share inputs from a L2/3 cell was high in cell pairs of the same subtypes, compared with those in different subtype pairs. Furthermore, the common input probability was highly selective when cell pairs of the same subtypes, but not different subtypes, had connections between them. Our results suggest that L2/3 pyramidal cells selectively innervate L5 cells, depending on their firing subtypes.},

In layer 5 (L5) of the rat frontal cortex, there are 2 major subtypes of PCs that differ in their long-range axonal projections, corticopontine (CPn) cells and crossed corticostriatal (CCS) cells. The outputs of these L5 PCs can be regulated by feedback inhibition from neighboring cortical GABAergic cells. Two major subtypes of GABAergic cells are parvalbumin (PV)-positive and somatostatin (SOM)-positive cells. PV cells have a fast-spiking (FS) firing pattern, while SOM cells have a low threshold spike (LTS) and regular spiking. In this study, we found that the 2 PC subtypes in L5 selectively make recurrent connections with LTS cells. The connection patterns correlated with the morphological and physiological diversity of LTS cells. LTS cells with high input resistance (Ri) exhibited more compact dendrites and more rebound spikes than LTS cells with low Ri, which had vertically elongated dendrites. LTS subgroups differently inhibited the PC subtypes, although FS cells made nonselective connections with both projection subtypes. These results demonstrate a novel recurrent network of inhibitory and projection-specific excitatory neurons within the neocortex.},

The two types were morphologically differentiated in regard to their apical tufts. The dendritic morphologies of CCS cells were correlated with their somatic depth within the cortex. CCS cells had reciprocal synaptic connections with each other and also provided synaptic input to CPn cells. However, connections from CPn to CCS cells were rarely found, even in pairs showing CCS to CPn connectivity. Additionally, CCS cells preferentially innervated the basal dendrites of other CCS cells but made contacts onto both the basal and apical dendrites of CPn cells. The amplitude of synaptic responses was to some extent correlated with the contact site number. Ratios of the EPSC amplitude to the contact number tended to be larger in the CCS to CCS connection. Therefore, our data demonstrate that these two types of corticostriatal cells distinct in their dendritic morphologies show directional and domain-dependent preferences in their synaptic connectivity.},

  abstract = {The claustrum, a poorly understood subcortical structure located between the cortex and the striatum, forms widespread connections with almost all cortical areas, but the cellular organization of claustral circuits remains largely unknown. Based primarily on anatomical data, it has been proposed that the claustrum integrates activity across sensory modalities. However, the extent to which the synaptic organization of claustral circuits supports this integration is unclear. Here, we used paired whole-cell recordings and optogenetic approaches in mouse brain slices to determine the cellular organization of the claustrum. We found that unitary synaptic connections among claustrocortical (ClaC) neurons were rare. In contrast, parvalbumin-positive (PV) inhibitory interneurons were highly interconnected with both chemical and electrical synapses. In addition, ClaC neurons and PV interneurons formed frequent synaptic connections. As suggested by anatomical data, we found that corticoclaustral afferents formed monosynaptic connections onto both ClaC neurons and PV interneurons. However, the responses to cortical input were comparatively stronger in PV interneurons. Consistent with this overall circuit organization, activation of corticoclaustral afferents generated monosynaptic excitatory responses as well as disynaptic inhibitory responses in ClaC neurons. These data indicate that recurrent excitatory circuits within the claustrum alone are unlikely to integrate across multiple sensory modalities. Rather, this cellular organization is typical of circuits sensitive to correlated inputs. Although single ClaC neurons may integrate corticoclaustral input from different cortical regions, these results are consistent with more recent proposals implicating the claustrum in detecting sensory novelty or in amplifying correlated cortical inputs to coordinate the activity of functionally related cortical regions.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The function of the claustrum, a brain nucleus found in mammals, remains poorly understood. It has been proposed, based primarily on anatomical data, that claustral circuits play an integrative role and contribute to multimodal sensory integration. Here we show that the principal neurons of the claustrum, claustrocortical (ClaC) projection neurons, rarely form synaptic connections with one another and are unlikely to contribute to broad integration within the claustrum. We show that, although single ClaC neurons may integrate corticoclaustral inputs carrying information for different sensory modalities, the synaptic organization of ClaC neurons, local parvalbumin-positive interneurons within the claustrum, and cortical afferents is also consistent with recent proposals that the claustrum plays a role in detecting salient stimuli or amplifying correlated cortical inputs.},

  abstract = {Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an increasingly common technique used to selectively modify neural excitability and plasticity. There is still controversy concerning the cortical response to rTMS of different frequencies. In this study, a novel in vitro paradigm utilizing the Multi-Electrodes Array (MEA) system and acute cerebellar slicing is described. In a controllable environment that comprises perfusion, incubation, recording and stimulation modules, the spontaneous single-unit spiking activity in response to rTMS of different frequencies and powers was directly measured and analyzed. Investigation using this in vitro paradigm revealed frequency-dependent modulation upon the excitability and functional connectivity of cerebellar slices. The 1-Hz rTMS sessions induced short-term inhibition or lagged inhibition, whereas 20-Hz sessions induced excitation. The level of modulation is influenced by the value of power. However the long-term response fluctuated without persistent direction. The choice of evaluation method may also interfere with the interpretation of modulation direction. Furthermore, both short-term and long-term functional connectivity was strengthened by 1-Hz rTMS and weakened by 20-Hz rTMS.},

  abstract = {Distributed microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from consistent, viable, $\geq$500 $\mu$m thick tissue preparations over time periods from days to weeks may aid in studying a wide range of problems in neurobiology that require in vivo-like organotypic morphology. Existing tools for electrically interfacing with organotypic slices do not address necrosis that inevitably occurs within thick slices with limited diffusion of nutrients and gas, and limited removal of waste. We developed an integrated device that enables long-term maintenance of thick, functionally active, brain tissue models using interstitial perfusion and distributed recordings from thick sections of explanted tissue on a perforated multi-electrode array. This novel device allows for automated culturing, in situ imaging, and extracellular multi-electrode interfacing with brain slices, 3-D cell cultures, and potentially other tissue culture models. The device is economical, easy to assemble, and integrable with standard electrophysiology tools. We found that convective perfusion through the culture thickness provided a functional benefit to the preparations as firing rates were generally higher in perfused cultures compared to their respective unperfused controls. This work is a step toward the development of integrated tools for days-long experiments with more consistent, healthier, thicker, and functionally more active tissue cultures with built-in distributed electrophysiological recording and stimulation functionality. The results may be useful for the study of normal processes, pathological conditions, and drug screening strategies currently hindered by the limitations of acute (a few hours long) brain slice preparations.},

This allows easy in vitro patch-clamp experimentation using adult deep cerebellar nuclear slices, which until now have been considered very difficult. As proof of the concept, we compare intrinsic properties of cerebellar nuclear neurons in juvenile ($<$1 month) and adult (up to 7 months) mice, and confirm that no significant developmental changes occur after the fourth postnatal week.

However, anatomical reconstructions of individual layer 6 corticothalamic (L6 CT) neurons include examples with axonal processes ramifying within layer 5, and the relative input of the overall population of L6 CT neurons to layers 4 and 5 is not well understood. We compared the synaptic impact of L6 CT cells on neurons in layers 4 and 5. We found that the axons of L6 CT neurons densely ramified within layer 5a in both visual and somatosensory cortices of the mouse. Optogenetic activation of corticothalamic neurons generated large EPSPs in pyramidal neurons in layer 5a. In contrast, excitatory neurons in layer 4 exhibited weak excitation or disynaptic inhibition. Fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive cells in both layer 5a and layer 4 were also strongly activated by L6 CT neurons. The overall effect of L6 CT activation was to suppress layer 4 while eliciting action potentials in layer 5a pyramidal neurons. Together, our data indicate that L6 CT neurons strongly activate an output layer of the cortex.},

  shorttitle = {Relative Clustering Validity Criteria},
  doi = {10.1002/sam.10080},
  abstract = {Many different relative clustering validity criteria exist that are very useful in practice as quantitative measures for evaluating the quality of data partitions, and new criteria have still been proposed from time to time. These criteria are endowed with particular features that may make each of them able to outperform others in specific classes of problems. In addition, they may have completely different computational requirements. Then, it is a hard task for the user to choose a specific criterion when he or she faces such a variety of possibilities. For this reason, a relevant issue within the field of clustering analysis consists of comparing the performances of existing validity criteria and, eventually, that of a new criterion to be proposed. In spite of this, the comparison paradigm traditionally adopted in the literature is subject to some conceptual limitations. The present paper describes an alternative, possibly complementary methodology for comparing clustering validity criteria and uses it to make an extensive comparison of the performances of 40 criteria over a collection of 962,928 partitions derived from five well-known clustering algorithms and 1080 different data sets of a given class of interest. A detailed review of the relative criteria under investigation is also provided that includes an original comparative asymptotic analysis of their computational complexities. This work is intended to be a complement of the classic study reported in 1985 by Milligan and Cooper as well as a thorough extension of a preliminary paper by the authors themselves.

Population synchrony was strongest during sharp wave (SPW) bursts. However, the increase was three times larger for pyramidal cells than for interneurons. The contribution of single pyramidal cells to the discharge of interneurons was often large (up to 0.6 probability), as assessed by the presence of significant ($<$3 ms) peaks in the cross-correlogram. Complex-spike bursts were more effective than single spikes. Single cell contribution was higher between SPW bursts than during SPWs or theta activity. Hence, single pyramidal cells can reliably discharge interneurons, and the probability of spike transmission is behavior dependent.},

  abstract = {The influence of cortical cell spiking activity on nearby cells has been studied extensively in vitro. Less is known, however, about the impact of single cell firing on local cortical networks in vivo. In a pioneering study, Kwan et al. (Kwan et al., 2012) reported that in mouse layer 2/3 (L2/3), under anesthesia, stimulating a single pyramidal cell recruits \textasciitilde{}1.7\% of neighboring pyramidal units. Here we employ two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with single-cell patch clamp stimulation, to probe, in both the awake and lightly anesthetized states, how i) activating single L2/3 pyramidal neurons recruits neighboring units within L2/3 and from layer 4 (L4) to L2/3, and whether ii) activating single pyramidal neurons changes population activity in local circuit. To do this, it was essential to develop an algorithm capable of quantifying how sensitive the calcium signal is at detecting effectively recruited units (followers). This algorithm allowed us to estimate the chance of detecting a follower as a function of the probability that an epoch of stimulation elicits one extra action potential (AP) in the follower cell. Using this approach, we found only a small fraction ($<$0.75\%) of L2/3 cells to be significantly activated within a radius of \textasciitilde{}200 microns from a stimulated neighboring L2/3 pyramidal cell. This fraction did not change significantly in the awake versus the lightly anesthetized state, nor when stimulating L2/3 versus underlying L4 pyramidal neurons. These numbers are in general agreement with, though lower than, the percentage of neighboring cells (2.1\%) reported by Kwan et al. to be activated upon stimulating single L2/3 pyramidal neurons under anesthesia (Kwan et al., 2012). Interestingly, despite the small number of individual units found to be reliably driven, we did observe a modest but significant elevation in aggregate population responses compared to sham stimulation. This underscores the distributed impact that single cell stimulation has on neighboring microcircuit responses, revealing only a small minority of relatively strongly connected partners.},

We examined whether and how hippocampal theta oscillations affect neocortical assembly patterns by recording populations of single cells and transient gamma oscillations in multiple cortical regions, including the somatosensory area and prefrontal cortex in behaving rats and mice. Laminar analysis of neocortical gamma bursts revealed multiple gamma oscillators of varying frequency and location, which were spatially confined and synchronized local groups of neurons. A significant fraction of putative pyramidal cells and interneurons as well as localized gamma oscillations in all recorded neocortical areas were phase-biased by the hippocampal theta rhythm. We hypothesize that temporal coordination of neocortical gamma oscillators by hippocampal theta is a mechanism by which information contained in spatially widespread neocortical assemblies can be synchronously transferred to the associative networks of the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {A key issue in systems neuroscience is the contribution of precise temporal inter-neuronal interactions to information processing in the brain, and the main analytical tool used for studying pair-wise interactions is the cross-correlation histogram (CCH). Although simple to generate, a CCH is influenced by multiple factors in addition to precise temporal correlations between two spike trains, thus complicating its interpretation. A Monte-Carlo-based technique, the jittering method, has been suggested to isolate the contribution of precise temporal interactions to neural information processing. Here, we show that jittering spike trains is equivalent to convolving the CCH derived from the original trains with a finite window and using a Poisson distribution to estimate probabilities. Both procedures over-fit the original spike trains and therefore the resulting statistical tests are biased and have low power. We devise an alternative method, based on convolving the CCH with a partially hollowed window, and illustrate its utility using artificial and real spike trains. The modified convolution method is unbiased, has high power, and is computationally fast. We recommend caution in the use of the jittering method and in the interpretation of results based on it, and suggest using the modified convolution method for detecting precise temporal correlations between spike trains.},

  abstract = {Neurophysiological recordings have revealed that the discharges of nearby cortical cells are positively correlated in time scales that range from millisecond synchronization of action potentials to much slower firing rate co-variations, evident in rates averaged over hundreds of milliseconds. The presence of correlated firing can offer insights into the patterns of connectivity between neurons; however, few models of population coding have taken account of the neuronal diversity present in cerebral cortex, notably a distinction between inhibitory and excitatory cells. We addressed this question in the monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex by recording neuronal activity from multiple micro-electrodes, typically spaced 0.2\textendash{}0.3 mm apart. Putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons were distinguished based on their action potential waveform and baseline discharge rate. We tested each pair of simultaneously recorded neurons for presence of significant cross-correlation peaks and measured the correlation of their averaged firing rates in successive trials. When observed, cross-correlation peaks were centered attime 0, indicating synchronous firing consistent with two neurons receiving common input. Discharges in pairs of putative inhibitory interneurons were found to be significantly more strongly correlated than in pairs of putative excitatory cells. The degree of correlated firing was also higher for neurons with similar spatial receptive fields and neurons active in the same epochs of the behavioral task. These factors were important in predicting the strength of both short time scale ($<$5 ms) correlations and of trial-to-trial discharge rate covariations. Correlated firing was only marginally accounted for by motor and behavioral variations between trials. Our findings suggest that nearby inhibitory neurons are more tightly synchronized than excitatory ones and account for much of the correlated discharges commonly observed in undifferentiated cortical networks. In contrast, the discharge of pyramidal neurons, the sole projection cells of the cerebral cortex, appears largely independent, suggesting that correlated firing may be a property confined within local circuits and only to a lesser degree propagated to distant cortical areas and modules.},

Although the coordination of neuronal activity in PFC is thought to be maintained by a network of recurrent connections, direct physiological evidence regarding such networks is sparse. To gain insight into the functional organization of the working memory system in vivo, we recorded simultaneously from multiple neurons spaced 0.2\textendash{}1 mm apart in monkeys performing an oculomotor delayed response task. We used cross-correlation analysis and characterized the effective connectivity between neurons in relation to their spatial and temporal response properties. The majority of narrow ($<$5 msec) cross-correlation peaks indicated common input and were most often observed between pairs of neurons within 0.3 mm of each other. Neurons recorded at these distances represented the full range of spatial locations, suggesting that the entire visual hemifield is represented in modules of corresponding dimensions. Nearby neurons could be activated in any epoch of the behavioral task (stimulus presentation, delay, response). The incidence and strength of cross-correlation, however, was highest among cells sharing similar spatial tuning and similar temporal profiles of activation across task epochs. The dependence of correlated discharge on the functional properties of neurons was observed both when we analyzed firing from the task period as well as from baseline fixation. Our results suggest that the coding specificity of individual neurons extends to the local circuits of which they are part.},

  abstract = {Optimizing spike-sorting algorithms is difficult because sorted clusters can rarely be checked against independently obtained ``ground truth'' data. In most spike-sorting algorithms in use today, the optimality of a clustering solution is assessed relative to some assumption on the distribution of the spike shapes associated with a particular single unit (e.g., Gaussianity) and by visual inspection of the clustering solution followed by manual validation. When the spatiotemporal waveforms of spikes from different cells overlap, the decision as to whether two spikes should be assigned to the same source can be quite subjective, if it is not based on reliable quantitative measures. We propose a new approach, whereby spike clusters are identified from the most consensual partition across an ensemble of clustering solutions. Using the variability of the clustering solutions across successive iterations of the same clustering algorithm (template matching based on K-means clusters), we estimate the probability of spikes being clustered together and identify groups of spikes that are not statistically distinguishable from one another. Thus, we identify spikes that are most likely to be clustered together and therefore correspond to consistent spike clusters. This method has the potential advantage that it does not rely on any model of the spike shapes. It also provides estimates of the proportion of misclassified spikes for each of the identified clusters. We tested our algorithm on several datasets for which there exists a ground truth (simultaneous intracellular data), and show that it performs close to the optimum reached by a support vector machine trained on the ground truth. We also show that the estimated rate of misclassification matches the proportion of misclassified spikes measured from the ground truth data.},

  abstract = {Multineuron firing patterns are often observed, yet are predicted to be rare by models that assume independent firing. To explain these correlated network states, two groups recently applied a second-order maximum entropy model that used only observed firing rates and pairwise interactions as parameters (Schneidman et al., 2006; Shlens et al., 2006). Interestingly, with these minimal assumptions they predicted 90\textendash{}99\% of network correlations. If generally applicable, this approach could vastly simplify analyses of complex networks. However, this initial work was done largely on retinal tissue, and its applicability to cortical circuits is mostly unknown. This work also did not address the temporal evolution of correlated states. To investigate these issues, we applied the model to multielectrode data containing spontaneous spikes or local field potentials from cortical slices and cultures. The model worked slightly less well in cortex than in retina, accounting for 88 $\pm$ 7\% (mean $\pm$ SD) of network correlations. In addition, in 8 of 13 preparations, the observed sequences of correlated states were significantly longer than predicted by concatenating states from the model. This suggested that temporal dependencies are a common feature of cortical network activity, and should be considered in future models. We found a significant relationship between strong pairwise temporal correlations and observed sequence length, suggesting that pairwise temporal correlations may allow the model to be extended into the temporal domain. We conclude that although a second-order maximum entropy model successfully predicts correlated states in cortical networks, it should be extended to account for temporal correlations observed between states.},

In the hippocampus, cell assemblies forming mnemonic representations of space are thought to arise as a result of changes in functional connections of pyramidal cells. We have found that CA1 interneuron circuits are also reconfigured during goal-oriented spatial learning through modification of inputs from pyramidal cells. As learning progressed, new pyramidal assemblies expressed in theta cycles alternated with previously established ones, and eventually overtook them. The firing patterns of interneurons developed a relationship to new, learning-related assemblies: some interneurons associated their activity with new pyramidal assemblies while some others dissociated from them. These firing associations were explained by changes in the weight of monosynaptic inputs received by interneurons from new pyramidal assemblies, as these predicted the associational changes. Spatial learning thus engages circuit modifications in the hippocampus that incorporate a redistribution of inhibitory activity that might assist in the segregation of competing pyramidal cell assembly patterns in space and time.},

This procedure involves the use of fine glass micro-pipettes (tip diameter: $\approx$ 1 $\mu$m), which contain biocytin or Neurobiotin dissolved in a salt solution, for the simultaneous juxtacellular recording and tracer iontophoresis. Once a neuron is well-isolated and identified, low intensity ($<$ 10 nA) positive-current pulses are injected by way of the micro-electrode such as to modulate its firing. Juxtacellular tracer iontophoresis may last as long as the cell electrophysiologically remains in good health, while determining some of its physiological properties. Control experiments, including the selective killing of previously injected cells, provide convincing evidence that it is the stained unit that was recorded and `tickled' by the juxtamembranous iontophoretic pulses. Electrophysiological and histochemical data further show that neuronal filling could occur during an electrically induced, transient, physical micro-damage of a somatic or dendritic membrane patch. This simple, single-cell staining method has been used to label several types of rat brain neurons, including projection neurons and interneurons. Its success rate ($>$ 86\%) far exceeds that obtained by direct intracellular injections of tracers as shown by the labeling of a large sample of 100 individual cells (from 115 attempts) in the thalamic reticular (Rt) nucleus of 33 rats. We thereby demonstrate that Rt cells project to restricted regions of a single thalamic nucleus, including anterior thalamic nuclei, and that the thalamus and Rt complex have reciprocal connections. The juxtacellular procedure thus represents an ideal directed single-cell labeling tool for determination of functional properties, for subsequent identification, for delineation of overall neuronal architecture and for tracing neuronal pathways, provided care is taken to avoid the possible drawbacks and pitfalls that are illustrated and discussed in the present paper.},

Here, we present a highly efficient, online capable spike detection algorithm, and an offline method with improved detection rates, which enables estimation of spatial event locations at a resolution higher than that provided by the array by combining information from multiple electrodes. Data acquired with a 4,096 channel MEA from neuronal cultures and the neonatal retina, as well as synthetic data was used to test and validate these methods. We demonstrate that these algorithms outperform conventional methods due to a better noise estimate and an improved signal-to-noise ratio through combining information from multiple electrodes. Finally, we present a new approach for analyzing population activity based on the characterization of the spatio-temporal event profile, which does not require the isolation of single units.

We present a method for automated spike sorting for recordings with high-density, large-scale multielectrode arrays. Exploiting the dense sampling of single neurons by multiple electrodes, an efficient, low-dimensional representation of detected spikes consisting of estimated spatial spike locations and dominant spike shape features is exploited for fast and reliable clustering into single units. Millions of events can be sorted in minutes, and the method is parallelized and scales better than quadratically with the number of detected spikes. Performance is demonstrated using recordings with a 4,096-channel array and validated using anatomical imaging, optogenetic stimulation, and model-based quality control. A comparison with semi-automated, shape-based spike sorting exposes significant limitations of conventional methods. Our approach demonstrates that it is feasible to reliably isolate the activity of up to thousands of neurons and that dense, multi-channel probes substantially aid reliable spike sorting.$<$/p$>$

By combining these methods with labeling and imaging, we showed that up to 95\% of the ganglion cells over the area of the array were recorded. By measuring the coverage of visual space by the receptive fields of the recorded cells, we concluded that our technique captured a neural population that forms an essentially complete representation of a region of visual space. This completeness allowed us to determine the spatial layout of different cell types as well as identify a novel group of ganglion cells that responded reliably to a set of naturalistic and artificial stimuli but had no measurable receptive field. Thus, our method allows unprecedented access to the complete neural representation of visual information, a crucial step for the understanding of population coding in sensory systems.},

In recent years, multi-electrode arrays and large silicon probes have been developed to record simultaneously from hundreds or thousands of electrodes packed with a high density. However, these new devices challenge the classical way to do spike sorting. Here we developed a new method to solve these issues, based on a highly automated algorithm to extract spikes from extracellular data, and show that this algorithm reached near optimal performance both in vitro and in vivo. The algorithm is composed of two main steps: 1) a "template-finding" phase to extract the cell templates, i.e. the pattern of activity evoked over many electrodes when one neuron fires an action potential; 2) a "template-matching" phase where the templates were matched to the raw data to find the location of the spikes. The manual intervention by the user was reduced to the minimal, and the time spent on manual curation did not scale with the number of electrodes. We tested our algorithm with large-scale data from in vitro and in vivo recordings, from 32 to 4225 electrodes. We performed simultaneous extracellular and patch recordings to obtain "ground truth" data, i.e. cases where the solution to the sorting problem is at least partially known. The performance of our algorithm was always close to the best expected performance. We thus provide a general solution to sort spikes from large-scale extracellular recordings.},

Here we propose a new parameter estimation technique that does not require computing an intractable normalization factor or sampling from the equilibrium distribution of the model. This is achieved by establishing dynamics that would transform the observed data distribution into the model distribution, and then setting as the objective the minimization of the KL divergence between the data distribution and the distribution produced by running the dynamics for an infinitesimal time. Score matching, minimum velocity learning, and certain forms of contrastive divergence are shown to be special cases of this learning technique. We demonstrate parameter estimation in Ising models, deep belief networks and an independent component analysis model of natural scenes. In the Ising model case, current state of the art techniques are outperformed by at least an order of magnitude in learning time, with lower error in recovered coupling parameters.},

Additionally, we give the first efficient algorithm for learning Ising models over general alphabets. Our main application is an algorithm for learning the structure of t-wise MRFs with nearly-optimal sample complexity (up to polynomial losses in necessary terms that depend on the weights) and running time that is \$n\^\{O(t)\}\$. In addition, given \$n\^\{O(t)\}\$ samples, we can also learn the parameters of the model and generate a hypothesis that is close in statistical distance to the true MRF. All prior work runs in time \$n\^\{$\backslash$Omega(d)\}\$ for graphs of bounded degree d and does not generate a hypothesis close in statistical distance even for t=3. We observe that our runtime has the correct dependence on n and t assuming the hardness of learning sparse parities with noise. Our algorithm--the Sparsitron-- is easy to implement (has only one parameter) and holds in the on-line setting. Its analysis applies a regret bound from Freund and Schapire's classic Hedge algorithm.

We design a reinforcement learning algorithm in which the set of visible nodes representing the states and actions of an optimal policy are the first and last layers of the deep network. In absence of a transverse field, our simulations show that DBMs train more effectively than restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) with the same number of weights. Since sampling from Boltzmann distributions of a DBM is not classically feasible, this is evidence of advantage of a non-Turing sampling oracle. We then develop a framework for training the network as a quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM) in the presence of a significant transverse field for reinforcement learning.

  abstract = {Recent theoretical and experimental results suggest the possibility of using current and near-future quantum hardware in challenging sampling tasks. In this paper, we introduce free energy-based reinforcement learning (FERL) as an application of quantum hardware. We propose a method for processing a quantum annealer's measured qubit spin configurations in approximating the free energy of a quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM). We then apply this method to perform reinforcement learning on the grid-world problem using the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer. The experimental results show that our technique is a promising method for harnessing the power of quantum sampling in reinforcement learning tasks.},

Parvalbumin-positive (PV) inhibitory neurons, which are implicated in cortical oscillations and can change neuronal selectivity, may play a pivotal role in these dynamic changes. We found that optogenetic activation of PV neurons in the auditory cortex enhanced feed-forward functional connectivity in the putative thalamorecipient circuit and in cortical columnar circuits. In contrast, PV stimulation induced no change in connectivity between sites in the same layers. The activity of PV neurons may thus serve as a gating mechanism to enhance feed-forward, but not lateral or feedback, information flow in cortical circuits. Functionally, it may preferentially enhance the contribution of bottom-up sensory inputs to perception.},

Patterns of gene expression can be used to characterize and classify neuronal types. It is challenging, however, to generate taxonomies that fulfill the essential criteria of being comprehensive, harmonizing with conventional classification schemes, and lacking superfluous subdivisions of genuine types. To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of $\sim$25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class.$<$/p$>$

  abstract = {Inference of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (SCs) from the spike trains is poorly addressed in the literature due to the complexity of the problem. As recent technological advancements make recording spikes from multiple (neighbor) neurons of a behaving animal (in some rare cases from humans) possible, this paper tackles the problem of estimating SCs solely from the recorded spike trains. Given an ensemble of spikes corresponding to population of neighbor neurons, we aim to infer the average excitatory and inhibitory SCs underlying the shared neural activity. In this paper, we extended our previously established Kalman filtering (KF) based algorithm to incorporate the voltage-to-spike nonlinearity (mapping from membrane potential to spike rate). Having estimated the instantaneous spike rate using optimal linear filtering (Gaussian kernel), our proposed algorithm uses KF followed by expectation maximization (EM) algorithm in a recursive fashion to infer the average SCs. As the dynamics of SCs and membrane potential is included in our model, the proposed algorithm, unlike other related works, considers different sources of stochasticity, i.e., the variabilities of SCs, membrane potential, and spikes. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that our algorithm is blind to the external stimulus, and it performs only based on observed spikes. We validate the accuracy and practicality of our technique through simulation studies where leaky integrate and fire (LIF) model is used to generate spikes. We show that the estimated SCs can precisely track the original ones. Moreover, we show that the performance of our algorithm can be further improved given enough number of trials (spikes). As a rule of thumb, 50 trials of neurons with the average firing rate of 5 Hz can guarantee the accuracy of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Time-varying excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs govern activity of neurons and process information in the brain. The importance of trial-to-trial fluctuations of synaptic inputs has recently been investigated in neuroscience. Such fluctuations are ignored in the most conventional techniques because they are removed when trials are averaged during linear regression techniques. Here, we propose a novel recursive algorithm based on Gaussian mixture Kalman filtering for estimating time-varying excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs from single trials of noisy membrane potential in current clamp recordings. The Kalman filtering is followed by an expectation maximization algorithm to infer the statistical parameters (time-varying mean and variance) of the synaptic inputs in a non-parametric manner. As our proposed algorithm is repeated recursively, the inferred parameters of the mixtures are used to initiate the next iteration. Unlike other recent algorithms, our algorithm does not assume an a priori distribution from which the synaptic inputs are generated. Instead, the algorithm recursively estimates such a distribution by fitting a Gaussian mixture model. The performance of the proposed algorithms is compared to a previously proposed PF-based algorithm (Paninski et al., 2012) with several illustrative examples, assuming that the distribution of synaptic input is unknown. If noise is small, the performance of our algorithms is similar to that of the previous one. However, if noise is large, they can significantly outperform the previous proposal. These promising results suggest that our algorithm is a robust and efficient technique for estimating time varying excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from single trials of membrane potential recordings.},

This allows both smoothing of the data and inference of biophysically relevant parameters such as the density of (active) channels, input resistance, intercompartmental conductances, and noise levels; it does, however, depend on knowledge of active channel kinetics. The second method achieves smoothing of noisy traces by fitting arbitrary kinetics in a non-parametric manner. Both techniques can additionally be used to infer unobserved variables, for instance voltage from calcium concentration. This paper gives a detailed account of the methods and should allow for straightforward modification and inclusion of additional measurements.},

However, gap junction\textendash{}mediated synchrony has rarely been studied in the context of varying spatiotemporal patterns of electrical and chemical synaptic activity. Thus, the mechanism underlying fine-scale synchrony and its relationship to neural coding remain unclear. We examined spike synchrony in pairs of genetically identified, electrically coupled ganglion cells in mouse retina. We found that coincident electrical and chemical synaptic inputs, but not electrical inputs alone, elicited synchronized dendritic spikes in subregions of coupled dendritic trees. The resulting nonlinear integration produced fine-scale synchrony in the cells' spike output, specifically for light stimuli driving input to the regions of dendritic overlap. In addition, the strength of synchrony varied inversely with spike rate. Together, these features may allow synchronized activity to encode information about the spatial distribution of light that is ambiguous on the basis of spike rate alone.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0027431},
  abstract = {Transfer entropy (TE) is an information-theoretic measure which has received recent attention in neuroscience for its potential to identify effective connectivity between neurons. Calculating TE for large ensembles of spiking neurons is computationally intensive, and has caused most investigators to probe neural interactions at only a single time delay and at a message length of only a single time bin. This is problematic, as synaptic delays between cortical neurons, for example, range from one to tens of milliseconds. In addition, neurons produce bursts of spikes spanning multiple time bins. To address these issues, here we introduce a free software package that allows TE to be measured at multiple delays and message lengths. To assess performance, we applied these extensions of TE to a spiking cortical network model (Izhikevich, 2006) with known connectivity and a range of synaptic delays. For comparison, we also investigated single-delay TE, at a message length of one bin (D1TE), and cross-correlation (CC) methods. We found that D1TE could identify 36\% of true connections when evaluated at a false positive rate of 1\%. For extended versions of TE, this dramatically improved to 73\% of true connections. In addition, the connections correctly identified by extended versions of TE accounted for 85\% of the total synaptic weight in the network. Cross correlation methods generally performed more poorly than extended TE, but were useful when data length was short. A computational performance analysis demonstrated that the algorithm for extended TE, when used on currently available desktop computers, could extract effective connectivity from 1 hr recordings containing 200 neurons in $\sim$5 min. We conclude that extending TE to multiple delays and message lengths improves its ability to assess effective connectivity between spiking neurons. These extensions to TE soon could become practical tools for experimentalists who record hundreds of spiking neurons.},

It exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 Hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. Due to the interplay between the delays and STDP, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. To our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. We speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection (TNGS, neural Darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as ``attention to memories.''},

Recent improvements in neuronal recording techniques have made it possible to record the spiking activity from hundreds of neurons simultaneously with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Here we used a 512-channel multielectrode array system to record the activity from hundreds of neurons in organotypic cultures of cortico-hippocampal brain slices from mice. To probe the network structure, we employed a wavelet transform of the cross-correlogram to categorize the functional connectivity in different frequency ranges. With this method we directly compare, for the first time, in any preparation, the neuronal network structures of cortex and hippocampus, on the scale of hundreds of neurons, with sub-millisecond time resolution. Among the three frequency ranges that we investigated, the lower two frequency ranges (gamma (30\textendash{}80 Hz) and beta (12\textendash{}30 Hz) range) showed similar network structure between cortex and hippocampus, but there were many significant differences between these structures in the high frequency range (100\textendash{}1000 Hz). The high frequency networks in cortex showed short tailed degree-distributions, shorter decay length of connectivity density, smaller clustering coefficients, and positive assortativity. Our results suggest that our method can characterize frequency dependent differences of network architecture from different brain regions. Crucially, because these differences between brain regions require millisecond temporal scales to be observed and characterized, these results underscore the importance of high temporal resolution recordings for the understanding of functional networks in neuronal systems.},

The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20\% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40\% more visual information than optimal linear decoding6. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.},

However, real neurons integrate stimuli via the modulation of nonlinear excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances. Here we introduce a biophysically inspired point process model with conductance-based inputs. The model provides a novel interpretation of the popular Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) as a special kind of conductance-based model, where excitatory and inhibitory conductances are modulated in a "push-pull" manner so that total conductance remains constant. We relax this constraint to obtain a more general and flexible "conductance-based encoding model" (CBEM), which can exhibit stimulus-dependent fluctuations in gain and dynamics. We fit the model to spike trains of macaque retinal ganglion cells and show that, remarkably, we can accurately infer underlying inhibitory and excitatory conductances, using comparisons to intracellularly measured conductances. Using extracellular data, we corroborate the intracellular finding that synaptic excitation temporally precedes inhibition in retina. We show that the CBEM outperforms the classic GLM at predicting retinal ganglion cell responses to full-field stimuli, generalizes better across contrast levels, and captures inhibition-dependent response properties to spatially structured stimuli. The CBEM provides a powerful tool for gaining insights into the intracellular variables governing spiking, and forges an important link between extracellular characterization methods and biophysically detailed response models.},

These methods have been successful in determining potential cluster structure in various datasets, but they can be computationally expensive for datasets with a very large number of samples. A scalable version of iVAT called siVAT approximates iVAT images, but siVAT can be computationally expensive for big datasets. In this article, we introduce a modification of siVAT called siVAT+ which approximates cluster heat maps for large volumes of high dimensional data much more rapidly than siVAT. We compare siVAT+ with siVAT on six large, high dimensional datasets. Experimental results confirm that siVAT+ obtains images similar to siVAT images in a few seconds, and is 8 - 55 times faster than siVAT.},

  abstract = {Motivation: In neuroscience, as in many other scientific domains, the primary form of knowledge dissemination is through published articles. One challenge for modern neuroinformatics is finding methods to make the knowledge from the tremendous backlog of publications accessible for search, analysis and the integration of such data into computational models. A key example of this is metascale brain connectivity, where results are not reported in a normalized repository. Instead, these experimental results are published in natural language, scattered among individual scientific publications. This lack of normalization and centralization hinders the large-scale integration of brain connectivity results. In this article, we present text-mining models to extract and aggregate brain connectivity results from 13.2 million PubMed abstracts and 630\,216 full-text publications related to neuroscience. The brain regions are identified with three different named entity recognizers (NERs) and then normalized against two atlases: the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) and the atlas from the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS). We then use three different extractors to assess inter-region connectivity.Results: NERs and connectivity extractors are evaluated against a manually annotated corpus. The complete in litero extraction models are also evaluated against in~vivo connectivity data from ABA with an estimated precision of 78\%. The resulting database contains over 4 million brain region mentions and over 100\,000 (ABA) and 122\,000 (BAMS) potential brain region connections. This database drastically accelerates connectivity literature review, by providing a centralized repository of connectivity data to neuroscientists.Availability and implementation: The resulting models are publicly available at github.com/BlueBrain/bluima.Contact:renaud.richardet@epfl.chSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Simultaneously measuring the activities of all neurons in a mammalian brain at millisecond resolution is a challenge beyond the limits of existing techniques in neuroscience. Entirely new approaches may be required, motivating an analysis of the fundamental physical constraints on the problem. We outline the physical principles governing brain activity mapping using optical, electrical, magnetic resonance, and molecular modalities of neural recording. Focusing on the mouse brain, we analyze the scalability of each method, concentrating on the limitations imposed by spatiotemporal resolution, energy dissipation, and volume displacement. Based on this analysis, all existing approaches require orders of magnitude improvement in key parameters. Electrical recording is limited by the low multiplexing capacity of electrodes and their lack of intrinsic spatial resolution, optical methods are constrained by the scattering of visible light in brain tissue, magnetic resonance is hindered by the diffusion and relaxation timescales of water protons, and the implementation of molecular recording is complicated by the stochastic kinetics of enzymes. Understanding the physical limits of brain activity mapping may provide insight into opportunities for novel solutions. For example, unconventional methods for delivering electrodes may enable unprecedented numbers of recording sites, embedded optical devices could allow optical detectors to be placed within a few scattering lengths of the measured neurons, and new classes of molecularly engineered sensors might obviate cumbersome hardware architectures. We also study the physics of powering and communicating with microscale devices embedded in brain tissue and find that, while radio-frequency electromagnetic data transmission suffers from a severe power\textendash{}bandwidth tradeoff, communication via infrared light or ultrasound may allow high data rates due to the possibility of spatial multiplexing. The use of embedded local recording and wireless data transmission would only be viable, however, given major improvements to the power efficiency of microelectronic devices.},

  abstract = {Modern microelectrode arrays make it possible to simultaneously record population neural activity. However, methods to analyze multiunit activity (MUA), which reflects the aggregate spiking activity of a population of neurons, have remained underdeveloped in comparison to those used for studying single unit activity (SUA). In scenarios where SUA is hard to record and maintain or is not representative of brain's response, MUA is informative in deciphering the brain's complex time-varying response to stimuli or to clinical insults. Here, we present two quantitative methods of analysis of the time-varying dynamics of MUA without spike detection. These methods are based on the multiresolution discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of an envelope of MUA (eMUA) followed by information theoretic measures: multiresolution entropy (MRE) and the multiresolution Kullback\textendash{}Leibler distance (MRKLD).We test the proposed quantifiers on both simulated and experimental MUA recorded from rodent cortex in an experimental model of global hypoxic\textendash{}ischemic brain injury. First, our results validate the use of the eMUA as an alternative to detecting and analyzing transient and complex spike activity. Second, the MRE and MRKLD are shown to respond to dynamic changes due to the brain's response to global injury and to identify the transient changes in the MUA.},

Here we show that bandlimited interpolation with sample-and-hold delay correction reduces waveform variability, leading to improved reliability of threshold-based event detection and improved spike sorting accuracy. Interpolation of continuously acquired data is, however, computationally expensive. A cost-benefit analysis was made of varying sampling rates from 12.5 kHz (no interpolation) to 100 kHz (eight times oversampling, with respect to the Nyquist frequency), taking into consideration the final application of the data. For most purposes, including spike sorting, sample rates below 25 kHz with bandlimited interpolation to 50 kHz were ideal, with negligible gains above this rate. A practical benefit, especially for large electrode arrays, is that the bandwidth and storage requirements can be greatly reduced by using data acquisition rates at or slightly above the Nyquist frequency.},

  abstract = {Extracellular and intracellular records were made from guinea-pig hippocampal slices to examine the contributions of intrinsic cellular properties and synaptic events to the generation of neuronal activity. Extracellular signals were filtered to pass action potentials, which could be detected within a distance of about 80 $\mu$m from a discharging cell.Spontaneous action potentials were invariably detected in records from the stratum pyramidale of CA3 region. Blocking excitatory synaptic transmission with NBQX and APV reduced their frequency by 23 $\pm$ 35 \%. Suppressing synaptic inhibition, while excitation was already blocked, increased the rate of spike discharge to 177 $\pm$ 71 \% of its control value.Most action potentials recorded intracellularly from CA3 pyramidal cells were initiated in the absence of a detectable synaptic event. In contrast, most action potentials generated by inhibitory cells located close to stratum pyramidale were preceded by an EPSP.In 31 simultaneous recordings, intracellular pyramidal cell action potentials appeared consistently to initiate extracellular spikes with a mean latency of 2$\cdot$2 $\pm$ 1$\cdot$0 ms. Single inhibitory cell action potentials could initiate a reduction in the frequency of extracellular spikes of duration 10\textendash{}30 ms.Some identified extracellular spikes (n = 9) consistently preceded intracellularly recorded IPSPs. IPSPs were initiated monosynaptically with latencies of 0$\cdot$9\textendash{}1$\cdot$5 ms. In reciprocal interactions, single pyramidal cell action potentials could trigger the discharge of an identified unit that in turn appeared to initiate an IPSP in the same pyramidal cell.These data suggest that intrinsic cellular mechanisms underly much of the spontaneous activity of pyramidal cells of the CA3 region of the hippocampus in vitro. Both synaptic inhibition and a strong excitation of inhibitory cells by pyramidal cells act to reduce population activity.},

  abstract = {The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is vital for a range of brain functions requiring cognitive control and has highly divergent inputs and outputs, thus manifesting as a hub in connectomic analyses. Studies show diverse functional interactions within the ACC are associated with network oscillations in the $\beta$ (20\textendash{}30 Hz) and $\gamma$ (30-80 Hz) frequency range. Oscillations permit dynamic routing of information within cortex, a function that depends on bandpass filter\textendash{}like behavior to selectively respond to specific inputs. However, a putative hub region such as ACC needs to be able to combine inputs from multiple sources rather than select a single input at the expense of others. To address this potential functional dichotomy, we modeled local ACC network dynamics in the rat in vitro. Modal peak oscillation frequencies in the $\beta$- and $\gamma$-frequency band corresponded to GABAAergic synaptic kinetics as seen in other regions; however, the intrinsic properties of ACC principal neurons were highly diverse. Computational modeling predicted that this neuronal response diversity broadened the bandwidth for filtering rhythmic inputs and supported combination\textemdash{}rather than selection\textemdash{}of different frequencies within the canonical $\gamma$ and $\beta$ electroencephalograph bands. These findings suggest that oscillating neuronal populations can support either response selection (routing) or combination, depending on the interplay between the kinetics of synaptic inhibition and the degree of heterogeneity of principal cell intrinsic conductances.},

To interpret these recordings we need fast, scalable and accurate methods for spike sorting, whose output requires minimal time for manual curation. Here we introduce Kilosort, a spike sorting framework that meets these criteria, and show that it allows rapid and accurate sorting of large-scale in vivo data. Kilosort models the recorded voltage as a sum of template waveforms triggered on the spike times, allowing overlapping spikes to be identified and resolved. Rapid processing is achieved thanks to a novel low-dimensional approximation for the spatiotemporal distribution of each template, and to batch-based optimization on GPUs. A novel post-clustering merging step based on the continuity of the templates substantially reduces the requirement for subsequent manual curation operations. We compare Kilosort to an established algorithm on data obtained from 384-channel electrodes, and show superior performance, at much reduced processing times. Data from 384-channel electrode arrays can be processed in approximately realtime. Kilosort is an important step towards fully automated spike sorting of multichannel electrode recordings, and is freely available github.com/cortex-lab/Kilosort.},

Optical Ca2+ imaging3,4,5 offers more coverage but lacks the temporal resolution needed to distinguish individual spikes reliably and does not measure local field potentials. Until now, no technology compatible with use in unrestrained animals has combined high spatiotemporal resolution with large volume coverage. Here we design, fabricate and test a new silicon probe known as Neuropixels to meet this need. Each probe has 384 recording channels that can programmably address 960 complementary metal\textendash{}oxide\textendash{}semiconductor (CMOS) processing-compatible low-impedance TiN6 sites that tile a single 10-mm long, 70 \texttimes{} 20-$\mu$m cross-section shank. The 6 \texttimes{} 9-mm probe base is fabricated with the shank on a single chip. Voltage signals are filtered, amplified, multiplexed and digitized on the base, allowing the direct transmission of noise-free digital data from the probe. The combination of dense recording sites and high channel count yielded well-isolated spiking activity from hundreds of neurons per probe implanted in mice and rats. Using two probes, more than 700 well-isolated single neurons were recorded simultaneously from five brain structures in an awake mouse. The fully integrated functionality and small size of Neuropixels probes allowed large populations of neurons from several brain structures to be recorded in freely moving animals.

We formulate a model to study the influence of sorting errors on the significance of synchronized spikes, and thus are able to study if and how the significance changes in case of imperfect sorting. Here we explore the case of pairwise analysis of simultaneously recorded neurons. Interestingly, a decrease in the significance is observed in the presence of false positives, as well as for false negatives. Furthermore, false negative errors reduce the significance of synchronized spikes more strongly than false positives. Thus, conservative sorting strategies have a stronger tendency to lead to a loss of the significance of synchronization.

  doi = {10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.05.028},
  abstract = {Background
Measures of spike train synchrony are widely used in both experimental and computational neuroscience. Time-scale independent and parameter-free measures, such as the ISI-distance, the SPIKE-distance and SPIKE-synchronization, are preferable to time scale parametric measures, since by adapting to the local firing rate they take into account all the time scales of a given dataset.
New method
In data containing multiple time scales (e.g. regular spiking and bursts) one is typically less interested in the smallest time scales and a more adaptive approach is needed. Here we propose the A-ISI-distance, the A-SPIKE-distance and A-SPIKE-synchronization, which generalize the original measures by considering the local relative to the global time scales. For the A-SPIKE-distance we also introduce a rate-independent extension called the RIA-SPIKE-distance, which focuses specifically on spike timing.
Results
The adaptive generalizations A-ISI-distance and A-SPIKE-distance allow to disregard spike time differences that are not relevant on a more global scale. A-SPIKE-synchronization does not any longer demand an unreasonably high accuracy for spike doublets and coinciding bursts. Finally, the RIA-SPIKE-distance proves to be independent of rate ratios between spike trains.
Comparison with existing methods
We find that compared to the original versions the A-ISI-distance and the A-SPIKE-distance yield improvements for spike trains containing different time scales without exhibiting any unwanted side effects in other examples. A-SPIKE-synchronization matches spikes more efficiently than SPIKE-synchronization.
Conclusions
With these proposals we have completed the picture, since we now provide adaptive generalized measures that are sensitive to firing rate only (A-ISI-distance), to timing only (ARI-SPIKE-distance), and to both at the same time (A-SPIKE-distance).},

We used light stimulation to elicit a response from physiologically distinct types of RGCs and then utilized the dynamic-configurability capabilities of a microelectronics-based high-density microelectrode array (MEA) to record their synchronous action potentials. The layout characteristics of the MEA made it possible to stimulate and record from multiple, highly overlapping RGCs simultaneously without light-induced artifacts. The high-density of electrodes and the high signal-to-noise ratio of the MEA circuitry allowed for recording of the activity of each RGC on 14$\pm$7 electrodes. The spatial features of the electrical activity of each RGC greatly facilitated spike sorting. We were thus able to localize, identify and record from defined RGCs within a region of mouse retina. In addition, we stimulated and recorded from genetically modified RGCs to demonstrate the applicability of optogenetic methods, which introduces an additional feature to target a defined cell type. The developed methodologies can likewise be applied to other neuronal preparations including brain slices or cultured neurons.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of extracellular action potential (EAP) recordings monitoring brain activity, the biophysical origin and inherent variability of these signals remain enigmatic. We performed whole cell patch recordings of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in rat somatosensory cortex slice while positioning a silicon probe in their vicinity to concurrently record intra- and extracellular voltages for spike frequencies under 20 Hz. We characterize biophysical events and properties (intracellular spiking, extracellular resistivity, temporal jitter, etc.) related to EAP recordings at the single-neuron level in a layer-specific manner. Notably, EAP amplitude was found to decay as the inverse of distance between the soma and the recording electrode with similar (but not identical) resistivity across layers. Furthermore, we assessed a number of EAP features and their variability with spike activity: amplitude (but not temporal) features varied substantially ($\sim$30\textendash{}50\% compared with mean) and nonmonotonically as a function of spike frequency and spike order. Such EAP variation only partly reflects intracellular somatic spike variability and points to the plethora of processes contributing to the EAP. Also, we show that the shape of the EAP waveform is qualitatively similar to the negative of the temporal derivative to the intracellular somatic voltage, as expected from theory. Finally, we tested to what extent EAPs can impact the lowpass-filtered part of extracellular recordings, the local field potential (LFP), typically associated with synaptic activity. We found that spiking of excitatory neurons can significantly impact the LFP at frequencies as low as 20 Hz. Our results question the common assertion that the LFP acts as proxy for synaptic activity.},

We describe two measures of unit isolation quality, Lratio and Isolation Distance, and evaluate their performance using simulations and tetrode recordings. Both measures quantified how well separated the spikes of one cluster (putative neuron) were from other spikes recorded simultaneously on the same multichannel electrode. In simulations and tetrode recordings, both Lratio and Isolation Distance discriminated well- and poorly-separated clusters. In data sets from the rodent hippocampus in which neurons were simultaneously recorded intracellularly and extracellularly, values of Isolation Distance and Lratio were related to the correct identification of spikes. \textcopyright{} 2005 IBRO.

Theoretical analysis combined with patch clamp recordings from pairs of neocortical pyramidal neurons revealed that the rate of synaptic depression, which depends on the probability of neurotransmitter release, dictates the extent to which firing rate and temporal coherence of action potentials within a presynaptic population are signaled to the postsynaptic neuron. The postsynaptic response primarily reflects rates of firing when depression is slow and temporal coherence when depression is fast. A wide range of rates of synaptic depression between different pairs of pyramidal neurons was found, suggesting that the relative contribution of rate and temporal signals varies along a continuum. We conclude that by setting the rate of synaptic depression, release probability is an important factor in determining the neural code.$<$/p$>$},

However, this requires the rate and phase to vary independently, in contrast to recent suggestions5,6 that they are tightly coupled, both reflecting the amplitude of the cell's input. Here we show that the time of firing and firing rate are dissociable, and can represent two independent variables: respectively the animal's location within the place field, and its speed of movement through the field. Independent encoding of location together with actions and stimuli occurring there may help to explain the dual roles of the hippocampus in spatial and episodic memory7,8, or may indicate a more general role of the hippocampus in relational/declarative memory9,10.},

Hence it is critical to understand the physiological mechanisms that can generate precise spike timing in vivo, and the relationship between such a temporal code and a rate code. Here we propose a mechanism by which a temporal code can be generated through an interaction between an asymmetric rate code and oscillatory inhibition. Consistent with the predictions of our model, the rate3,4 and temporal5,6,7 codes of hippocampal pyramidal neurons are highly correlated. Furthermore, the temporal code becomes more robust with experience. The resulting spike timing satisfies the temporal order constraints of hebbian learning. Thus, oscillations and receptive field asymmetry may have a critical role in temporal sequence learning.},

When a neuron responds to a sensory stimulus, two fundamental codes [1\textendash{}6] may transmit the information specifying stimulus identity\textemdash{}spike rate (the total number of spikes in the sequence, normalized by time) and spike timing (the~detailed millisecond-scale temporal structure of the response). To assess the functional significance of these codes, we recorded neuronal responses in primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex of five rats as they used their whiskers to identify textured surfaces. From the spike trains evoked during whisker contact with the texture, we computed the information that rate and timing codes carried about texture identity and about the rat's choice. S1 and S2 spike timing carried more information about stimulus and about choice than spike rates; the conjunction of rate and timing carried more information than either code alone. Moreover, on trials when our spike-timing-decoding algorithm extracted faithful texture information, the rat was more likely to choose correctly; when our spike-timing-decoding algorithm extracted misleading texture information, the rat was more likely to err. For spike rate information, the relationship between faithfulness of the message and correct choice was significant but weaker. These results indicate that spike timing makes crucial contributions to tactile perception, complementing and surpassing those made by rate. The language by which somatosensory cortical neurons transmit information, and the readout mechanism used to produce behavior, appears to rely on multiplexed signals from spike rate and timing.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that changes in the balance between segregation and integration in brain networks can be tracked by time-resolved functional connectivity derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data and that fluctuations between segregated and integrated network states are related to human behavior. However, how these network states relate to structural connectivity is largely unknown. To obtain a better understanding of structural substrates for these network states, we investigated how the relationship between structural connectivity, derived from diffusion tractography, and functional connectivity, as measured by rs-fMRI, changes with fluctuations between segregated and integrated states in the human brain. We found that the similarity of edge weights between structural and functional connectivity was greater in the integrated state, especially at edges connecting the default mode and the dorsal attention networks. We also demonstrated that the similarity of network partitions, evaluated between structural and functional connectivity, increased and the density of direct structural connections within modules in functional networks was elevated during the integrated state. These results suggest that, when functional connectivity exhibited an integrated network topology, structural connectivity and functional connectivity were more closely linked to each other and direct structural connections mediated a larger proportion of neural communication within functional modules. Our findings point out the possibility of significant contributions of structural connections to integrative neural processes underlying human behavior.},

In the second part, I compare the accuracy of different mean field approximations on several models (diluted ferromagnets and spin glasses) defined on random graphs and regular lattices, showing which one is in general more effective. A simple improvement over these approximations is proposed. Also a fundamental limitation is found in using methods based on TAP and Bethe approximations in presence of an external field.},

A potent local generator has been characterized in thalamus, and local generators in neocortex have been suggested. Here we demonstrate that isolated rat neocortex generates delta rhythms in conditions mimicking the neuromodulatory state during deep sleep (low cholinergic and dopaminergic tone). The rhythm originated in an NMDA receptor-driven network of intrinsic bursting (IB) neurons in layer 5, activating a source of GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition. In contrast, regular spiking (RS) neurons in layer 5 generated theta-frequency outputs. In layer 2/3 principal cells, outputs from IB cells associated with IPSPs, whereas those from layer 5 RS neurons related to nested bursts of theta-frequency EPSPs. Both interlaminar spike and field correlations revealed a sequence of events whereby sparse spiking in layer 2/3 was partially reflected back from layer 5 on each delta period. We suggest that these reciprocal, interlaminar interactions may represent a ``Helmholtz machine''-like process to control synaptic rescaling during deep sleep.},

  abstract = {The extracellular action potentials recorded on an electrode result from the collective simultaneous electrophysiological activity of an unknown number of neurons. Identifying and assigning these action potentials to their firing neurons\textemdash`spike sorting'\textemdash{}is an indispensable step in studying the function and the response of an individual or ensemble of neurons to certain stimuli. Given the task of neural spike sorting, the determination of the number of clusters (neurons) is arguably the most difficult and challenging issue, due to the existence of background noise and the overlap and interactions among neurons in neighbouring regions. It is not surprising that some researchers still rely on visual inspection by experts to estimate the number of clusters in neural spike sorting. Manual inspection, however, is not suitable to processing the vast, ever-growing amount of neural data. To address this pressing need, in this paper, thirty-three clustering validity indices have been comprehensively reviewed and implemented to determine the number of clusters in neural datasets. To gauge the suitability of the indices to neural spike data, and inform the selection process, we then calculated the indices by applying k-means clustering to twenty widely used synthetic neural datasets and one empirical dataset, and compared the performance of these indices against preexisting ground truth labels. The results showed that the top five validity indices work consistently well across variations in noise level, both for the synthetic datasets and the real dataset. Using these top performing indices provides strong support for the determination of the number of neural clusters, which is essential in the spike sorting process.},

In this work we first review the inference algorithm introduced in Ferrari, Phys. Rev. E (2016) [1]. We then succeed in applying the algorithm to infer the model from a large ensemble of neurons recorded by multi-electrode array in human temporal cortex. We compare the Ising model performance in capturing the statistical properties of the network activity during wakefulness and deep sleep. For the latter, the pairwise model misses relevant transients of high network activity, suggesting that additional constraints are necessary to accurately model the data.},

Maximum entropy based Ising models have been suggested to discount the effect of indirect interactions and give good results in inferring the true anatomical connections. However, no benchmarking is currently available to assess the performance of Ising couplings against other functional connectivity metrics in the microscopic scale of neuronal networks through a wide set of network conditions and network structures. In this paper, we study the performance of the Ising model couplings to infer the synaptic connectivity in in silico networks of neurons and compare its performance against partial and cross-correlations~for different correlation levels, firing rates, network sizes, network densities, and topologies. Our results show that the relative performance amongst the three functional connectivity metrics depends primarily on the network correlation levels. Ising couplings detected the most structural links at very weak network correlation levels, and partial correlations outperformed Ising couplings and cross-correlations at strong correlation levels. The result was consistent across varying firing rates, network sizes, and topologies. The findings of this paper serve as a guide in choosing the right functional connectivity tool to reconstruct the structural connectivity.},

Here, we investigated functional networks of cortical neurons using correlation analysis to identify functional connectivity. To reconstruct the interaction network, we applied the Ising model based on the principle of maximum entropy. This allowed us to assess the interactions by measuring pairwise correlations and to assess the strength of coupling from the degree of synchrony. Visual responses were recorded in visual cortex of anesthetized cats, simultaneously from up to 24 neurons. First, pairwise correlations captured most of the patterns in the population's activity and, therefore, provided a reliable basis for the reconstruction of the interaction networks. Second, and most importantly, the resulting networks had small-world properties; the average path lengths were as short as in simulated random networks, but the clustering coefficients were larger. Neurons differed considerably with respect to the number and strength of interactions, suggesting the existence of ``hubs'' in the network. Notably, there was no evidence for scale-free properties. These results suggest that cortical networks are optimized for the coexistence of local and global computations: feature detection and feature integration or binding.},

The influence of recurrent connections on covariances can be characterized directly in linear models, where connectivity in the network is described by a matrix of linear coupling kernels.

We re-analyze data obtained from multielectrode recordings performed in vitro on the retina and in vivo on the prefrontal cortex. Recorded population sizes N range from N = 37 to N = 117 neurons. We compare the SCE method with the simplest mean field methods (corresponding to a Gaussian model) and with regularizations which favor sparse networks (L1 norm) or penalize large couplings (L2 norm). The network of the strongest interactions inferred via mean field methods generally agree with those obtained from SCE. Reconstruction of the sampled moments of the distributions, corresponding to neuron spiking frequencies and pairwise correlations, and the prediction of higher moments including three-cell correlations and multi-neuron firing frequencies, is more difficult than determining the large-scale structure of the interaction network, and apart from a cortical recording in which the measured correlation indices are small, these goals are achieved with the SCE but not with mean field approaches. We also find differences in the inferred structure of retinal and cortical networks: inferred interactions tend to be more irregular and sparse for cortical data than for retinal data. This result may reflect the structure of the recording. As a consequence the SCE is more effective for retinal data when expanding the entropy with respect to a mean field reference S -SMF, while expansions of the entropy S alone perform better for cortical data.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0118412},
  abstract = {Biological networks display a variety of activity patterns reflecting a web of interactions that is complex both in space and time. Yet inference methods have mainly focused on reconstructing, from the network's activity, the spatial structure, by assuming equilibrium conditions or, more recently, a probabilistic dynamics with a single arbitrary time-step. Here we show that, under this latter assumption, the inference procedure fails to reconstruct the synaptic matrix of a network of integrate-and-fire neurons when the chosen time scale of interaction does not closely match the synaptic delay or when no single time scale for the interaction can be identified; such failure, moreover, exposes a distinctive bias of the inference method that can lead to infer as inhibitory the excitatory synapses with interaction time scales longer than the model's time-step. We therefore introduce a new two-step method, that first infers through cross-correlation profiles the delay-structure of the network and then reconstructs the synaptic matrix, and successfully test it on networks with different topologies and in different activity regimes. Although step one is able to accurately recover the delay-structure of the network, thus getting rid of any a priori guess about the time scales of the interaction, the inference method introduces nonetheless an arbitrary time scale, the time-bin dt used to binarize the spike trains. We therefore analytically and numerically study how the choice of dt affects the inference in our network model, finding that the relationship between the inferred couplings and the real synaptic efficacies, albeit being quadratic in both cases, depends critically on dt for the excitatory synapses only, whilst being basically independent of it for the inhibitory ones.},

Among these models, pairwise models are very attractive in part because they can be fit using a reasonable amount of data: knowledge of the means and correlations between pairs of elements in the system is sufficient. Not surprisingly, then, using pairwise models for studying neural data has been the focus of many studies in recent years. In this paper, we describe how tools from statistical physics can be employed for studying and using pairwise models. We build on our previous work on the subject and study the relation between different methods for fitting these models and evaluating their quality. In particular, using data from simulated cortical networks we study how the quality of various approximate methods for inferring the parameters in a pairwise model depends on the time bin chosen for binning the data. We also study the effect of the size of the time bin on the model quality itself, again using simulated data. We show that using finer time bins increases the quality of the pairwise model. We offer new ways of deriving the expressions reported in our previous work for assessing the quality of pairwise models.},

  abstract = {One of the most critical problems we face in the study of biological systems is building accurate statistical descriptions of them. This problem has been particularly challenging because biological systems typically contain large numbers of interacting elements, which precludes the use of standard brute force approaches. Recently, though, several groups have reported that there may be an alternate strategy. The reports show that reliable statistical models can be built without knowledge of all the interactions in a system; instead, pairwise interactions can suffice. These findings, however, are based on the analysis of small subsystems. Here, we ask whether the observations will generalize to systems of realistic size, that is, whether pairwise models will provide reliable descriptions of true biological systems. Our results show that, in most cases, they will not. The reason is that there is a crossover in the predictive power of pairwise models: If the size of the subsystem is below the crossover point, then the results have no predictive power for large systems. If the size is above the crossover point, then the results may have predictive power. This work thus provides a general framework for determining the extent to which pairwise models can be used to predict the behavior of large biological systems. Applied to neural data, the size of most systems studied so far is below the crossover point.},

  abstract = {Activation of the cholinergic innervation of the cortex has been implicated in sensory processing, learning, and memory. At the cellular level, acetylcholine both increases excitability and depresses synaptic transmission, and its effects on network firing are hard to predict. We studied the effects of carbachol, a cholinergic agonist, on network firing in cultures of rat cortical neurons, using electrode arrays to monitor the activity of large numbers of neurons simultaneously. These cultures show stable spontaneous synchronized burst firing which propagates through dense synaptic connections. Carbachol (10 \textendash{}50 ␮M), acting through muscarinic receptors, was found to induce a switch to asynchronous single-spike firing and to result in a loss of regularity and fragmentation of the burst structure. To obtain a quantitative measure of cholinergic actions on cortical networks, we applied a cluster Poisson-process model to sets of paralleled spike-trains in the presence and absence of carbachol. This revealed that the time series can be well-characterized by such a simple model, consistent with the observed 1/f b-like spectra (0.04$<$b$<$2.08). After applying higher concentrations of carbachol the property of the spectra shifted toward a Poisson-process (white) spectrum. These results indicate that cholinergic neurotransmitters have a strong and reliable desynchronizing action on cortical neural activity. \textcopyright{} 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.},

We present a new approach that dramatically reduces the complexity of this problem. Large-scale multi-electrode recordings were used to measure electrical activity in nearly complete, regularly spaced mosaics of several hundred ON and OFF parasol retinal ganglion cells in macaque monkey retina. Parasol cells exhibited substantial pairwise correlations, as has been observed in other species, indicating functional connectivity. However, pairwise measurements alone are insufficient to determine the prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, which would be predicted from widely diverging common inputs and have been hypothesized to convey distinct visual messages to the brain. The number of possible multi-neuron firing patterns is far too large to study exhaustively, but this problem may be circumvented if two simple rules of connectivity can be established: (1) multi-cell firing patterns arise from multiple pairwise interactions, and (2) interactions are limited to adjacent cells in the mosaic. Using maximum entropy methods from statistical mechanics, we show that pairwise and adjacent interactions accurately accounted for the structure and prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, explaining $\sim$98\% of the departures from statistical independence in parasol cells and $\sim$99\% of the departures that were reproducible in repeated measurements. This approach provides a way to define limits on the complexity of network interactions and thus may be relevant for probing the function of many neural circuits.},

  abstract = {We present two graphical model-based approaches to analyse the distribution of neural activities in the prefrontal cortex of behaving rats. The first method aims at identifying cell assemblies, groups of synchronously activating neurons possibly representing the units of neural coding and memory. A graphical (Ising) model distribution of snapshots of the neural activities, with an effective connectivity matrix reproducing the correlation statistics, is inferred from multi-electrode recordings, and then simulated in the presence of a virtual external drive, favoring high activity (multi-neuron) configurations. As the drive increases groups of neurons may activate together, and reveal the existence of cell assemblies. The identified groups are then showed to strongly coactivate in the neural spiking data and to be highly specific of the inferred connectivity network, which offers a sparse representation of the correlation pattern across neural cells. The second method relies on the inference of a Generalized Linear Model, in which spiking events are integrated over time by neurons through an effective connectivity matrix. The functional connectivity matrices inferred with the two approaches are compared. Sampling of the inferred GLM distribution allows us to study the spatio-temporal patterns of activation of neurons within the identified cell assemblies, particularly their activation order: the prevalence of one order with respect to the others is weak and reflects the neuron average firing rates and the strength of the largest effective connections. Other properties of the identified cell assemblies (spatial distribution of coactivation events and firing rates of coactivating neurons) are discussed.},

Our goal is to re-introduce an optimized version of the partial correlation to infer structural connections from functional-effective ones in dissociated neuronal cultures coupled to microelectrode arrays. Approach. We first validate our partialization procedure on in silico networks, mimicking different experimental conditions (i.e., different connectivity degrees and number of nodes) and comparing the partial correlation's performance with two gold-standard methods: cross-correlation and transfer entropy. Afterwards, to infer the structural connections in in vitro neuronal networks where the ground truth is unknown, we propose a thresholding heuristic approach. Then, to validate whether the partialization process correctly reconstructs macroscopic features of the network structure, we extract a modularity index from segregated in silico and in vitro models. Finally, as a case study, we apply our partialization procedure to analyze connectivity and topology on spontaneous developing and electrically stimulated in vitro cultures. Main results. In simulated networks, partial correlation outperforms cross-correlation and transfer entropy at low and medium connectivity degrees, not only in relatively small (60 nodes) but also in larger (120\textendash{}240 nodes) assemblies. Furthermore, partial correlation correctly identifies interconnected neuronal sub-populations and allows one to derive network topology in in vitro cortical networks. Significance. Our results support the idea that partial correlation is a good method for connectivity studies and can be applied to derive topological and structural features of neuronal assemblies.},

  abstract = {External cluster validity indices (CVIs) are used to quantify the quality of a clustering by comparing the similarity between the clustering and a ground truth partition. However, some external CVIs show a biased behavior when selecting the most similar clustering. Users may consequently be misguided by such results. Recognizing and understanding the bias behavior of CVIs is therefore crucial.
It has been noticed that, some external CVIs exhibit a preferential bias towards a larger or smaller number of clusters which is monotonic (directly or inversely) in the number of clusters in candidate partitions. This type of bias is caused by the functional form of the CVI model. For example, the popular Rand Index (RI) exhibits a monotone increasing (NCinc) bias, while the Jaccard Index (JI) index suffers from a monotone decreasing (NCdec) bias. This type of bias has been previously recognized in the literature.
In this work, we identify a new type of bias arising from the distribution of the ground truth (reference) partition against which candidate partitions are compared. We call this new type of bias ground truth (GT) bias. This type of bias occurs if a change in the reference partition causes a change in the bias status (e.g., NCinc, NCdec) of a CVI. For example, NCinc bias in the RI can be changed to NCdec bias by skewing the distribution of clusters in the ground truth partition. It is important for users to be aware of this new type of biased behavior, since it may affect the interpretations of CVI results.
The objective of this article is to study the empirical and theoretical implications of GT bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive study of such a property for external CVIs. Our computational experiments show that 5 of 26 pair-counting based CVIs studied in this paper, which are all functions of the RI, exhibit GT bias. Following the numerical examples, we provide a theoretical analysis of GT bias based on the relationship between the RI and quadratic entropy. Specifically, we prove that the quadratic entropy of the ground truth partition provides a computable test which predicts the NC bias status of the RI.},

Many prior studies have addressed this problem; however, generating a comprehensive description of cortical networks requires a large-scale, systematic approach. To that end, the Allen Institute for Brain Science is engaged in a pipeline project using multipatch electrophysiology, supplemented with 2-photon optogenetics, to characterize local connectivity and synaptic signaling between major classes of neurons in the adult mouse primary visual cortex and neurosurgical samples from human cortex. We focus on producing results that are detailed enough for the generation of computational models and enable rigorous comparison with future studies. Here we report our examination of the intralaminar connectivity within each of several classes of excitatory neurons. We find that connections are sparse but present among all excitatory cell types and layers we sampled, with the most sparse connections in layers 5 and 6. Almost all synapses in mouse exhibited short-term depression with similar dynamics. Synaptic signaling between a subset of layer 2/3 neurons, however, exhibited facilitation. These results contribute to a body of evidence describing recurrent excitatory connectivity as a conserved feature of cortical microcircuits.},

However, the available methods for measuring neck fluid volume (NFV) are inconvenient and expensive. Narrowing of the UA due to fluid accumulation could change acoustic characteristics of respiratory sounds. In this study, we developed a novel approach for non-invasive estimation of NFV from acoustic measurements. Twenty-eight healthy subjects lay awake and supine for 90 min while NFV and tracheal sounds were measured simultaneously using bioimpedance and a microphone, respectively. Sets of tracheal sound features were calculated in time and frequency domains and were reduced using methods based on regression and minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance. The resulting feature sets were applied to a multi-linear regression and a mixture-density neural network to estimate NFV. Our results show very small relative estimation errors of 1.25 and 3.23\%, based on the regression and neural network methods, respectively. These results support the practical application of this technology in diagnosing fluid accumulation in the neck and its possible contributions to the pathogenesis of OSA.},

This study aimed to investigate the sensitivity of the 3D intersegmental angles, measured using a multisegmented spinal column model, to errors due to marker misplacement. Eleven healthy subjects performed trunk bending in five directions. Six cameras recorded the trajectory of 22 markers, representing seven spinal column segments. Misplacement error for each marker was modeled as a Gaussian function with a standard deviation of 6\,mm, and constrained to a maximum value of 12\,mm in each coordinate across the skin. The sensitivity of 3D intersegmental angles to these marker misplacement errors, added to the measured data, was evaluated. The errors in sagittal plane motions resulting from marker misplacement were small (RMS error less than 3.2\,deg and relative error in the angular range less than 15\%) during the five trunk bending direction. The errors in the frontal and transverse plane motions, induced by marker misplacement, however, were large (RMS error up to 10.2\,deg and relative error in the range up to 58\%), especially during trunk bending in anterior, anterior-left, and anterior-right directions, and were often comparable in size to the intersubject variability for those motions. The induced errors in the frontal and transverse plane motions tended to be the greatest at the intersegmental levels in the lower lumbar region. These observations questioned reliability of angle measures in the frontal and transverse planes particularly in the lower lumbar region during trunk bending in anterior direction, and thus did not recommend interpreting these measures for clinical evaluation and decision-making.},

Such spike sorting is intrinsically unsupervised, as the number of neurons are not known a priori. Clustering can be performed using either the full dimensional waveforms or on low-dimensional representations obtained by dimensionality reduction or feature extraction methods. In this paper, we evaluate the utility of several methods for providing lower dimensional visualization of the cluster structure and on subsequent spike clustering. Experimental results are conducted on two datasets with ground truth labels. We also introduce a visualization technique called improved visual assessment of cluster tendency (iVAT) to estimate possible cluster structures in data without the need for dimensionality reduction. In data with a relatively small number of clusters, iVAT is beneficial in estimating the number of clusters to inform the initialization of clustering algorithms. With larger numbers of clusters, iVAT gives a useful estimate of the coarse cluster structure but sometimes fails to indicate the presumptive number of clusters. We show that noise associated with recording extracellular neuronal potentials can disrupt computational clustering schemes, highlighting the benefit of probabilistic clustering models. Results show that t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) feature extraction provides representations of the data that yield more accurate clustering than low-dimensional representations obtained with four other methods. Moreover, the clustering obtained using t-SNE representation outperforms clustering within the other four feature spaces and also with algorithms operating directly within the input dimensional space.},

This network behavior is typically characterized by short-duration bursts, separated by order of magnitude longer interburst intervals. We hypothesize that while short-timescale synaptic processes modulate spectro-temporal intraburst properties and network-wide burst propagation, much longer timescales of intrinsic membrane properties such as persistent sodium (Nap) currents govern burst onset during interburst intervals. To test this, we used synaptic receptor antagonists picrotoxin, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), and 3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate (CPP) to selectively block GABAA, AMPA, and NMDA receptors and riluzole to selectively block Nap channels. We systematically compared intracellular activity (recorded with patch clamp) and network activity (recorded with multielectrode arrays) in eight different synaptic connectivity conditions: GABAA + NMDA + AMPA, NMDA + AMPA, GABAA + AMPA, GABAA + NMDA, AMPA, NMDA, GABAA, and all receptors blocked. Furthermore, we used mixed-effects modeling to quantify the aforementioned independent and interactive synaptic receptor contributions toward spectro-temporal burst properties including intraburst spike rate, burst activity index, burst duration, power in the local field potential, network connectivity, and transmission delays. We found that blocking intrinsic Nap currents completely abolished bursting activity, demonstrating their critical role in burst onset within the network. On the other hand, blocking different combinations of synaptic receptors revealed that spectro-temporal burst properties are uniquely associated with synaptic functionality and that excitatory connectivity is necessary for the presence of network-wide bursting. In addition to confirming the critical contribution of direct excitatory effects, mixed-effects modeling also revealed distinct combined (nonlinear) contributions of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity to network bursting properties.},

Inverse statistical physics approaches, which infer effective couplings between neurons from their spiking activity, have been so far hindered by their computational complexity. Here, we present 2 complementary, computationally efficient inverse algorithms based on the Ising and ``leaky integrate-and-fire'' models. We apply those algorithms to reanalyze multielectrode recordings in the salamander retina in darkness and under random visual stimulus. We find strong positive couplings between nearby ganglion cells common to both stimuli, whereas long-range couplings appear under random stimulus only. The uncertainty on the inferred couplings due to limitations in the recordings (duration, small area covered on the retina) is discussed. Our methods will allow real-time evaluation of couplings for large assemblies of neurons.},

Here, we propose to infer effective coupling networks and model distributions for the activity of simultaneously recorded neurons in prefrontal cortex, during the performance of a decision-making task, and during preceding and following sleep epochs. Our approach, inspired from statistical physics, allows us to define putative cell assemblies as the groups of co-activated neurons in the models of the three recorded epochs. It reveals the existence of task-related changes of the effective couplings between the sleep epochs. The assemblies which strongly coactivate during the task epoch are found to replay during subsequent sleep, in correspondence to the changes of the inferred network. Across sessions, a variety of different network scenarios is observed, providing insight in cell assembly formation and replay.},

One possible reason for this is that such replay exchanges information between hippocampus and neocortex, supporting consolidation. We recorded neuron ensembles in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to study memory trace reactivation during SWS following learning and execution of cross-modal strategy shifts. In general, reactivation of learning-related patterns occurred in distinct, highly synchronized transient bouts, mostly simultaneous with hippocampal sharp wave/ripple complexes (SPWRs), when hippocampal ensemble reactivation and cortico-hippocampal interaction is enhanced. During sleep following learning of a new rule, mPFC neural patterns that appeared during response selection replayed prominently, coincident with hippocampal SPWRs. This was learning dependent, as the patterns appeared only after rule acquisition. Therefore, learning, or the resulting reliable reward, influenced which patterns were most strongly encoded and successively reactivated in the hippocampal/prefrontal network.},

This persistent activity was associated with a depolarizing plateau potential induced by the activation of a persistent Na+ current. Singlecell RT-PCR revealed that these neurons were inhibitory interneurons. This type of neuron was found in different cortical regions, including temporal, frontal, occipital, and parietal cortices in human and also in frontal and temporal lobes of nonhuman primate but not in rat cortical tissues, suggesting that it could be unique to primates.

While much effort has been devoted to comparative studies of neurons, astrocytes have received far less attention. We report here that protoplasmic astrocytes in human neocortex are 2.6 fold larger in diameter and extend 10-fold more GFAP+ primary processes than their rodent counterparts. In cortical slices prepared from acutely resected surgical tissue, protoplasmic astrocytes propagate Ca2+ waves with a speed of 36 $\mathrm{\mu}$m/second, approximately 4-fold faster than rodent. Human astrocytes also transiently increase cystosolic Ca2+ in response to glutamatergic and purinergic receptor agonists. The human neocortex also harbors several anatomically-defined subclasses of astrocytes not represented in rodents. These include a population of astrocytes that reside in layers 5\textendash{}6 and extend long fibers characterized by regularly spaced varicosities. Another specialized type of astrocyte, the interlaminar astrocyte, abundantly populates the superficial cortical layers and extends long processes without varicosities to cortical layers 3 and 4. Human fibrous astrocytes resemble their rodent counterpart, but are larger in diameter. Thus, human cortical astrocytes are both larger, and structurally both more complex and more diverse, than those of rodents. On this basis, we posit that this astrocytic complexity has permitted the increased functional competence of the adult human brain.},

  abstract = {The projection of cells in different layers of several cortical visual areas in the cat were studied using the method of retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. Injections of the enzyme were made through a recording micropipette, making it possible to localize the injection site by physiological criteria. We found that layer VI cells projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus, while a distinct population of cells in layer V projected to the superior colliculus. Cells in layers II and III were the major sources of ipsilateral cortico-cortical connections. This pattern of projection was consistent from one visual area to another. Pyramidal cells appeared to be the source of cortico-geniculate, cortico-collicular and cortico-cortical projections. The proportion of cells within a layer that terminated in a given site varied from layer to layer: apparently all of the large pyramids in layer V had terminals in the superior colliculus, about half of the pyramids in layer VI had terminals in the lateral geniculate nucleus, while only a small proportion of the pyramids in layers II and III had terminals in any single cortical area. The results indicated a remarkable specificity in the projections of the cortical layers. The cortical connections of the different cell types in layers A and A1 of the lateral geniculate nucleus were also examined: the cells that projected to area 17 were much more numerous and were on the average smaller than those that projected to area 18. Projections to the cortex were also found from the pulvinar, the medial interlaminar nucleus and the posterior nucleus. Direct connections were observed to the lateral geniculate nucleus from several midbrain reticular nuclei. Finally, projections were found to the superior colliculus from the zona incerta, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus and the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus.},

  abstract = {The retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase has been used to identify efferent cells in area 17 of the macaque. Cells projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus are small to medium sized pyramidal neurons with somata in lamina 6 and the adjacent white matter. The projection to the parvocellular division arises preferentially from the upper half of lamina 6, while that to the magnocellular division arises preferentially from the lower part of the lamina. The projection to both superior colliculus and inferior pulvinar arises from all sizes of pyramidal neurons lying in lamina 5B (Lund and Boothe, '75); at least the largest pyramidal neurons of lamina 5B send collateral axon branches to both destinations. Injections with extensive spread of horseradish peroxidase show that many cells of lamina 4B and the large pyramidal neurons of upper lamina 6 also project extrinsically but their terminal sites have not been identified. Other studies have indicated that cells of laminae 2 and 3 project to areas 18 and 19. Therefore every lamina of the visual cortex, with the exception of those receiving a direct thalamic input, contains cells projecting extrinsically. Further, each lamina projects to a different destination and from Golgi studies can be shown to contain cells with specific patterns of dendritic branching which relate to the distribution of thalamic afferents and to the patterns of intracortical connections. These findings emphasise the significance of the horizontal organisation of the cortex with relation to the flow of information through it and contrast with the current concept of columnar organisation shown in physiological studies.},

  doi = {10.1002/cne.901580304},
  abstract = {The striate cortex of the macaque monkey is subdivided into two independent and overlapping systems of columns termed ``orientation columns'' and ``ocular dominance columns.'' The present paper is concerned with the orientation columns, particularly their geometry and the relationship between successive columns. The arrangement of the columns is highly ordered; in the great majority of oblique or tangential microelectrode penetrations the preferred orientations of cells changed systematically with electrode position, in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Graphs of orientation vs. electrode track distance were virtually straight lines over distances of up to several millimeters; such orderly sequences were often terminated by sudden changes in the direction of orientation shifts, from clockwise to counterclockwise or back. The orientations at which these reversals occurred were quite unpredictable. Total rotations of 18\% 360'' were frequently seen between reversals. In tangential or almost tangential penetrations orientation shifts occurred almost every time the electrode was moved forward, indicating that the columns were either not discrete or had a thickness of less than 25-50 p, the smallest order of distance that our methods could resolve. In penetrations that were almost perpendicular to the surface, the graphs of orientation vs. track distance were relatively flatter, as expected if the surfaces of constant orientation are perpendicular to the cortical surface. S t e p wise changes in orientation of about 10'' could sometimes be seen in perpendicular penetrations, each orientation persisting through several clear advances of the electrode, suggesting a set of discrete columnar subdivisions. The possibility of some kind of continuous variation in orientation with horizontal distance along the cortex was not, however, completely ruled out. Occasionaliy a highly ordered sequence was broken by an abrupt large shift in orientation of up to 90''. Shifts in ocular dominance occurred roughly every 0.25-0.5 mm and were independent of orientation shifts. In multiple parallel penetrations spaced closer than about 250 p the slopes of the orientation vs. track distance curves were almost the same; reconstruction of these penetrations indicated that the regions of constant orientation are parallel sheets. On crossing perpendicular to these sheets, a total orientation shift of 180'' took place over a distance of 0.51.0 mm. Column thickness, size of shifts in orientation, and the rate of change of orientation with distance along the cortex seemed to be independent of eccentricity, at least between 2 '' and 15''from the fovea. A few penetrations made in area 17 of the cat and in area 18 of the monkey showed similar orderly sequences of receptive-field orientation shifts.},

It remains unclear, however, which structural elements\textemdash{}dendrites or axons\textemdash{}are ultimately responsible for conveying this sampling bias. To explore this question, we have examined the spatial arrangement of feedforward axonal connections that link non-oriented neurons in layer 4 and orientation-selective neurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex in the tree shrew. Target sites of labeled boutons in layer 2/3 resulting from focal injections of biocytin in layer 4 show an orientation-specific axial bias that is sufficient to confer orientation tuning to layer 2/3 neurons. We conclude that the anisotropic arrangement of axon terminals is the principal source of the orientation bias contributed by feedforward connections.},

  abstract = {The nature of cerebral cortical circuitry has been increasingly clarified by markers for the identification of precise cell types with specific morphology, connectivity and distinct physiological properties. Molecular markers are not only helpful in dissecting cortical circuitry, but also give insight into the mechanisms of cortical neuronal specification and differentiation. The two principal neuronal types of the cerebral cortex are the pyramidal and GABAergic cells. Pyramidal cells are excitatory and project to distant targets, while GABAergic neurons are mostly inhibitory non-pyramidal interneurons. Reliable markers for specific subtypes of interneurons are available and have been employed in the classification and functional analysis of cortical circuitry. Until recently, cortical pyramidal neurons have been considered a homogeneous class of cells. This concept is now changing as the powerful tools of molecular biology and genetics identify molecular tags for subtypes of pyramidal cells such as: Otx-1 [Frantz, G.D., Bohner, A.P., Akers, R.M., McConnell, S.K., 1994.

These genes outline the numerous subtypes of pyramidal cells and are increasingly refining our previous classifications. They also indicate specific developmental programs operate in cell fate decisions. This review will describe the progress made on the correlation of these markers to each other within a specific subtype of layer V neurons with identified, stereotypic projections. Further work is needed to link these data with observations on somatodendritic morphology and physiological properties. The integrated molecular, anatomical and physiological characterisation of pyramidal neurons will lead to a much better appreciation of functional cortical circuits.},

  abstract = {The appearance of the neocortex, its expansion, and its differentiation in mammals, represents one of the principal episodes in the evolution of the vertebrate brain. One of the fundamental questions in neuroscience is what is special about the neocortex of humans and how does it differ from that of other species? It is clear that distinct cortical areas show important differences within both the same and different species, and this has led to some researchers emphasizing the similarities whereas others focus on the differences. In general, despite of the large number of different elements that contribute to neocortical circuits, it is thought that neocortical neurons are organized into multiple, small repeating microcircuits, based around pyramidal cells and their input-output connections. These inputs originate from extrinsic afferent systems, excitatory glutamatergic spiny cells (which include other pyramidal cells and spiny stellate cells), and inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. The problem is that the neuronal elements that make up the basic microcircuit are differentiated into subtypes, some of which are lacking or highly modified in different cortical areas or species. Furthermore, the number of neurons contained in a discrete vertical cylinder of cortical tissue varies across species. Additionally, it has been shown that the neuropil in different cortical areas of the human, rat and mouse has a characteristic layer specific synaptology. These variations most likely reflect functional differences in the specific cortical circuits. The laminar specific similarities between cortical areas and between species, with respect to the percentage, length and density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and to the number of synapses per neuron, might be considered as the basic cortical building bricks. In turn, the differences probably indicate the evolutionary adaptation of excitatory and inhibitory circuits to particular functions.},

  abstract = {Neurons of the neocortex differ dramatically in the patterns of action potentials they generate in response to current steps. Regular-spiking cells adapt strongly during maintained stimuli, whereas fast-spiking cells can sustain very high firing frequencies with little or no adaptation. Instrinsically bursting cells generate clusters of spikes (bursts), either singly or repetitively. These physiological distinctions have morphological correlates. RS and IB cells can be either pyramidal neurons or spiny stellate cells, and thus constitute the excitatory cells of the cortex. FS cells are smooth or sparsely spiny non-pyramidal cells, and are likely to be GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. The different firing properties of neurons in neocortex contribute significantly to its network behavior.},

Dynamic properties of corticothalamic neurons and local cortical interneurons generating fast rhythmic (30\textendash{}40 Hz) spike-bursts. J. Neurophysiol. 79: 483\textendash{}490, 1998. Fast spontaneous oscillations (mainly 30\textendash{}40 Hz) characterize cortical and thalamic neuronal networks during behavioral states of increased vigilance and depend on cell depolarization under the influence of ascending activating systems. We investigated, by means of intracellular recording and staining in vivo, the properties of fast-oscillating cortical neurons from cat's motor and association areas, some projecting to the thalamus, others with locally arborizing axons. At a given level of depolarization, 28\% of our neuronal sample discharged high-frequency spike bursts (300\textendash{}600 Hz) that recurred rhythmically between 20 and 50 Hz. Such fast rhythmic bursting neurons have been found in both superficial and deep cortical layers. Slight changes in membrane potential as well as synaptic activity in thalamocortical networks dramatically altered the discharge patterns, from single spikes to rhythmic spike-bursts, and eventually to fast tonic firing without frequency adaptation. Thus our data challenge the conventional idea that sharply defined, invariant features and distinct locations in certain cortical layers characterize some neocortical cell-classes. We demonstrate that the distinctions between intrinsic electrophysiological properties of neocortical neurons are much more labile than conventionally thought. The present results, which indicate that corticothalamic neurons discharge fast rhythmic spike bursts mainly at 30\textendash{}40 Hz, suggest that this activity results in integrated fast oscillations within corticothalamic networks.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the input-output characteristics of various neuronal types is a necessary first step toward an understanding of cellular events related to waking and sleep. In spite of the oversimplification involved, the dichotomy in terms of type I (long-axoned, output) neurons and type II (short-axoned, local) interneurons is helpful in functionally delineating the neuronal circuits involved in the genesis and epiphenomena of waking and sleep states. The possibility is envisaged that cortical interneurons, which are particularly related to higher neuronal activity and have been found in previous experiments to be more active during sleep than during wakefulness, might be involved in complex integrative processes occurring during certain sleep stages. Electrophysiological criteria for the identification of output cells and interneurons are developed, with emphasis on various possibilities and difficulties involved in recognizing interneurons of the mammalian brain. The high-frequency repetitive activity of interneurons is discussed, together with various possibilities of error to be avoided when interpreting data from bursting cells. Data first show opposite changes in spontaneous and evoked discharges of identified output cells versus putative interneurons recorded from motor and parietal association cortical areas in behaving monkeys and cats during wakefulness (W) compared to sleep with synchronized EEG activity (S): significantly increased rates of spontaneous firing, enhanced antidromic or synaptic responsiveness, associated with shorter periods of inhibition in type I (pyramidal tract, cortico-thalamic and cortico-pontine) cells during W versus significantly decreased frequencies of spontaneous discharge and depression of synaptically elicited reponses of type II cells during W compared to S. These findings are partly explained on the basis of recent iontophoretic studies showing that acetylcholine, viewed as a synaptic transmitter of the arousal system, excites output-type neurons and inhibits high-frequency bursting cells. Comparing W and S to the deepest stage of sleep with desynchronized EEG activity (D) in type I and type II cells revealed that: (a) the increased firing rates of output cells in D, over those in W and S, is substantially due to a tonic excitation during this state, and rapid eye movements (RE Ms) only contribute to the further increase of discharge frequencies; (b) in contrast, the increased rates of discharge in interneurons during D is entirely ascribable to REM-related firing. On the basis of experiments reporting that increased duration of D has beneficial effects upon retention of information acquired during W, the suggestion is made that increased firing rates of association cortical interneurons during REM epochs of D sleep are an important factor in maintaining the soundness of a memory trace.},

Less well understood is how these interlaminar connections and ongoing fluctuations contribute to the regulation of visual spiking responses. Here, we investigate the relationship between alpha fluctuations and spiking responses to visual stimuli across cortical layers. Using laminar probes in macaque V1, we show that neural firing couples with the phase of alpha fluctuations, and that magnitude of this coupling is particularly pronounced during visual stimulation. The strongest modulation of spiking activity was observed in layers 2/3. Alpha-spike coupling and current source density analysis pointed to an infragranular origin of the alpha fluctuations. Taken together, these results indicate that ongoing infragranular alpha-range fluctuations in V1 play a role in regulating columnar visual activity.},

The combined model, APP.V717I \texttimes{} Tau.P301L bigenic mice (biAT mice) exhibit aggravated amyloid and tau pathology with severe cognitive and behavioral defects. In the present study, we investigated early changes in synaptic function in the CA1 and CA3 regions of acute hippocampal slices of young APP.V717I, Tau.P301L and biAT transgenic animals. We have used planar multielectrode arrays (MEA) and improved methods for simultaneous multi-site recordings from two hippocampal sub-regions. In the CA1 region, long-term potentiation (LTP) was severely impaired in all transgenic animals when compared with age-matched wild-type controls, while basal synaptic transmission and paired-pulse facilitation were minimally affected. In the CA3 region, LTP was normal in Tau.P301L and APP.V717I but clearly impaired in biAT mice. Surprisingly, frequency facilitation in CA3 was significantly enhanced in Tau. P301L mice, while not affected in APP.V717I mice and depressed in biAT mice. The findings demonstrate important synaptic changes that differ considerably in the hippocampal sub-regions already at young age, well before the typical amyloid or tau pathology is evident.},

Using a 60-channel perforated multi-electrode array (pMEA) on corticohippocampal slices from 2 to 3 week old mice we recorded interictal- and ictal-like events. When glutamatergic transmission was blocked, interictal-like events no longer initiated in the hilus or CA3/CA1 pyramidal layers but originated from the dentate gyrus granule and molecular layers. Furthermore, frequencies of interictal-like events were reduced and durations were increased in these regions while cortical discharges were completely blocked. Following GABAA receptor blockade interictal-like events no longer propagated to the dentate gyrus while their frequency in CA3 increased; in addition, ictal-like cortical events became shorter while increasing in frequency. Lastly, drugs that affect tonic and synaptic GABAergic conductance modulated the frequency, duration, initiation and propagation of interictal-like events. These findings confirm and expand on previous studies indicating that multiple synaptic mechanisms contribute to synchronize neuronal network activity in forebrain structures.},

We tested whether h-channels more prominently contribute to the physiological properties of human compared to mouse supragranular pyramidal neurons. Single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing revealed ubiquitous HCN1-subunit expression in excitatory neurons in human, but not mouse supragranular layers. Using patch-clamp recordings, we found stronger h-channel-related membrane properties in supragranular pyramidal neurons in human temporal cortex, compared to mouse supragranular pyramidal neurons in temporal association area. The magnitude of these differences depended upon cortical depth and was largest in pyramidal neurons in deep L3. Additionally, pharmacologically blocking h-channels produced a larger change in membrane properties in human compared to mouse neurons. Finally, using biophysical modeling, we provided evidence that h-channels promote the transfer of theta frequencies from dendrite-to-soma in human L3 pyramidal neurons. Thus, h-channels contribute to between-species differences in a fundamental neuronal property.},
