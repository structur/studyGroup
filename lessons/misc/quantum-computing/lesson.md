This is a beginner level introduction to quantum computing. It assumes some knowledge of vectors and matrices.

We go over the matrix algebra for qubits, some examples of quantum gates acting on them, and simulate them in Python. 

Then we go through Grover's search algorithm in Python and try it out on the IBM quantum experience machine.

See the [notebooks](https://github.com/UofTCoders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/misc/quantum-computing/grovers-algorthim-2-qubits.ipynb) in the linked folder and [QuantumComputing_UofTcoders.pdf](https://github.com/UofTCoders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/misc/quantum-computing/QuantumComputing_UofTcoders.phd) for the slides.
