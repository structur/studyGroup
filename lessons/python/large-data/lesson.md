This lesson contains two parts: 1st, accessing and storing data from personal genomic DNA sequencing results using the pandas.DataFrame structure; 2nd, finding shared motifs in single-cell PCR sequencing results.

To follow along, visit [the IPython notebook](https://github.com/uoftcoders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/python/large-data/LargeDatasetsPython.ipynb).

The [generic_gdna.txt](https://github.com/uoftcoders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/python/large-data/generic_gdna.txt) file contains a sample personal gDNA chip sequencing output.

The [generic_tcr.txt](https://github.com/uoftcoders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/python/large-data/generic_tcr.txt) file is a tab-separated plain text file containing 10 sample single-cell PCR sequencing results of the [T cell receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor).
