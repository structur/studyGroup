## Preface: ##

This is a very basic introduction to the Python programming language,
based largely off of the tutorials in the [Beginners' Guide to Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers),
in particular the [Learn Python Tutorials](https://pythonspot.com/).

Only the command line and a basic text editor are required, but quite
a few integrated development environments exist, however, including [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html)
and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).  Madeleine recommends
[WingIDE101](https://www.wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101/5.1.5-1).

## Lesson Overview: ##

Python implementations generally interpret code (though compilers
also exist).  The interpreter that comes with python is accessible
by typing

    python

into the command line (or clicking the executable on your GUI).
To run scripts and programs, we can instead type

    python practice_code.py

[IPython](https://ipython.org/) is an improved interactive console
that's both easier to use and supports additional functionality.
To run IPython, type

    ipython

To run scripts and programs within ipython, type within IPython

    run practice_code.py

The lesson covers:

* Hello World and print statements
* Number and string manipulation
* Lists, tuples and dicts
* Importing libraries
* Function declaration
* IPython debugging

The [official Python documentation site](https://docs.python.org) goes into much more detail
regarding all topics covered in this code-along.  Python is supported
by a very, very extensive breadth of packages, a list can be found [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)
Like with git, please check out [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) for
 any question on it.
