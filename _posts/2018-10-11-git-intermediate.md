title: "Intermediate Topics in Git and GitHub"
text: "In this session, we will build on the material presented at last week's Intro to Git and will discuss more advanced ways to use Git in collaboration with others. The material will be aimed at an audience that has some familiarity with basic Git commands, but by no means do you need to be experienced or an expert. If you attended last week's session or have used Git before or have looked over the material from last week, you should be well-prepared.
