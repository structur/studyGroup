title: "Code Review"
text: "We will have a brief overview of code review (looking over code for mistakes,  optimization etc. to increase the overall quality of the code),  why you should do it, and how to do it. Then we will jump in and  look at some of the attendees' code in pairs or groups.  If you have some code that is currently being developed,  we encourage you to bring it to the session for code review.  Don't worry if you haven't fully optimized it yet,  that's why we're holding this session :)  Or if you'd prefer you can take part as just a reviewer  instead and see how others write code and help them check for errors too!
