title: "Statistics in R"
text: "Building from our previous lesson, we will go over more advanced statistical analyses using the R programming language, and especially cases where your data may be a little bit messy or you might be working with repeated-measures data (also known as hierarchical data or within-subject data). We'll assume that you are familiar with basic linear regression (e.g. testing if x predicts y) and statistics basics (e.g. how to interpret a p-value), but we will do a brief review and explain everything else as we go!
