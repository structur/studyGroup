title: "Best practices for reproducible programming"
text: "People are talking a lot these days about research being  'open' and 'reproducible'. It all sounds great, but HOW do we do it?  How can we apply these great ideals to our actual work? This week we'll discuss reproducible computational research,  guided by [Ten simple rules for computational research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285) and Mozilla's [code review guidelines](https://mozillascience.github.io/codeReview/review.html)
